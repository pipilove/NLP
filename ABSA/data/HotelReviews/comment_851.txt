A word of warning

I had booked a room through the company's own web-site, and specified a room with three beds when booking a triple. The written email confirmation stated a room with a double and two singles.Me and my two companions arrived at 10:30 at night and were given the room key, where we discovered that there was a double and a single bed.On querying this at reception, I was told that they only received information on the number of occupants and allocated a room accordingly (a triple in this case rather than a quad in the case of a double and two singles). Although I presented the written email confirmation, the receptionist told me they were fully booked and the best they could do was to provide some additional blankets.I felt the receptionists response was poor and asked to see the manager.The manager couldn't have been more helpful. He phoned around other Accor hotels around Berlin and transferred our booking to the Novotel Tiergarten at no extra charge (two twin rooms), and gave us a free drink while we waited for the free taxi transfer.The manager's response and attitude was excellent.However, I felt let down that a. either the booking system doesn't provide you with the room that you think you booked, or the receptionist just lied because they'd given our room to someone else.b. the suitehotel's rooms looked great and there was a really nice atmosphere in the bar - and we were transfered to a 'better' (more starchy and less fun) hotel. Kind of like getting a steak after you'd been craving that cheeseburger you'd ordered.In fairness, this hotel deserves more than one tripadvisor star, but I wanted to get your attention - if you think you might need to, make sure you send an email to confirm exactly what you have booked.
