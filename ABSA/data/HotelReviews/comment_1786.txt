Great value and location!

Last winter, when a rare Seattle snow storm knocked out our power, I checked into this hotel with my teenage daughter. They only had one room left since many other locals were doing the same to keep warm. Despite the high demand, they did not gouge me. The room was small, but nice with a decent view of the Sound and the Space Needle. It's located in walking friendly lower Queen Anne with many good restaurants nearby and I cinema on the next block. Add the Starbucks on the ground floor and you can't ask for more for the money! Highly recommend if you don't need to be right downtown.
