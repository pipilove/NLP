AVoid at all costs

My sister reserved a suite of rooms for guests for her wedding. We booked one of these rooms more than a month in advance, then called to reconfirm several weeks before. We got email confirmations both times. When we arrived at the hotel they said sorry, we have your reservation but we have no room. This was late at night and I have an eight year old son. They agreed to put us up at another hotel, but were unpleasant an unaccomodating. And, the two rooms my sister in law had booked for her children were also not available and she had talked to them three times beforehand. So she and my brother had a room, but their teenage children did not and we were completely separated in a hotel across town away from the wedding party. If you don't mind booking way in advance, getting several confirmaitions and then being shuffled off to some other hotel this is the hotel for you. Otherwise stay away.
