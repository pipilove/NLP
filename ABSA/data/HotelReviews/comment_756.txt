Well maintained, but no luxury

The hotel has a convenient location, just off Friedrichstrasse which is the main shopping street in the centre of Berlin. The hotel is midsize, and combines some features of a big hotel (such as wireless internet in most rooms and a rather big and nice lounge) with some features of a small hotel (notably the bar is tiny and the breakfast room not impressive).The hotel rooms are remarkably spacious, with large windows in most rooms which makes them very light. The size of the room allows such things as placing the desk and tv set in the middle rather than in a corner, which makes working the room certainly more pleasant and less cramped. The furniture however is a bit dull and IKEA style. In fact there is not much furniture at all. But what is in the room is well-maintained and well-cleaned. Just don't expect any special luxury, and you won't be disappointed.
