The Place to Stay in Seattle

I am very particular and I was very happy with our choice to stay at the Sheraton. Since I was working remotely while my husband was attending a convention we upgraded to a club room with a desk. This gave us access to a great continental breakfast and evening munchies. The staff was very friendly, the beds were comfortable and the room was very clean. We walked all over town from here. Avoid the double decker Gray Line tour. Dinner at the Space Needle as the sunset was a splurge, but well worth it. Wild Ginger, McCormick and Schmicks, Top pot donuts, and skating along the sound helped to make it a great working vacation. I lived in Center City Philadelphia for 10 years and was still shocked by the number of homeless people in Seattle.
