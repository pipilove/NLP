Perfect Location

A great hotel in a perfect location. On the main shopping street and within walking distance to nearly all the sights and the nightlife. The staff were really friendly and accommodating giving us a late checkout on our last day. The U-Bhan/S-Bhan system is very efficient and cheap too. Berlin in really cheap for food and drinks(even more so than Prague) and everyone is friendly and helpful.I thoroughly recommend this city to anyone!!
