An OK place to stay for the price

The Moore is located perfectly within easy walking distances of most attractions and downtown Seattle. As others have described its an old place and in need of an update but its fine for the money. I tried three rooms and not a single lock worked properly, took several minutes to lock the room. Receptionists are friendly and Internet access is a big plus point, you'll have an ok time if you're just expecting a basic place to sleep.
