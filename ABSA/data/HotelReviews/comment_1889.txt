Fantastic Location

Stayed here in August 2005 on our first visit to Australia. The staff were OK but only a few of them gave you a genuine smile. The 8th floor Harbour View room was excellent with a stunning view across the whole of Darling Harbour. The bed was huge but a bit too soft. The location is brilliant as all the major sites are within walking distance as well as the best shopping areas. There are some top restaurants in Darling Harbour and many others are just minutes away. You really can't go wrong with this location. We will definitely be back one day.
