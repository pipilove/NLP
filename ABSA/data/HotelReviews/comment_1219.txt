Upsetting Experience

My granddaugher and I were in SF over Chinese New Year/President's weekend. We arrived early, understood that the room may not be ready. We sent to lunch, came back around 2:15 - room not ready. Granddaughter feeling ill. We ask when can the room be ready, but never got a response back from the clerk or housekeeping. Around 2:45 I ask a different clerk when the room would be ready. Did not get response back from housekeeping or follow up by the desk clerk. Around 3:00 I ask yet another desk clerk when will the room be ready. She did give me a discount on the room as it was not ready on time, but at that point the money was not an issue - I just wanted a room, any room, as my granddaughter was feeling worse. Time passes ............ we finally get a room around after 3:30.But the keys do not work. Housekeeping has to open the door for us, but now my granddaughter is upset and starting to cry, I am upset, so we go down to the lobby and say we are not staying, we are leaving. The desk clerk says you are welcome to leave, but you must pay for the room. Needless to say, we are all upset at this time, and there is no talking to the deskclerk. So, we leave the hotel, and go home. We never stayed, we were in the room at most 30 seconds, we are upset due to the management staff, and yet we must pay for a room that we did not use. I felt that the management staff could have done better, that all they needed to do was follow up on my requests for a time when the room would be ready. In short, the Chancellor will never receive a recommendation from me.
