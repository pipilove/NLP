Grand Hotel, Great Location

My hubby and I stayed at this property for 6 days over new year of 2006. This is a great property in SF, best location of all, we think. We were warned that parking in SF is very expensive($40/day), we don't want to waste money on parking at all. So without a rental, this property is the one. You can take the bart train from Airport to the Bart station at Pawell st, which is located just accross the street from the hotel. And if you do want to get out of town to check out other sites, you can easily rent a car for the day, which is very convinient. In town, the powell st cable cart is just around the corner. We got a room on the higher flr, so the noise level could be lower, and plus you get nice city view....they do have in-room high speed internet, but cost extral, I ordered it for a week, around $40, I think, which is worth it, since it is very good for finding out the stuff you want to do, restrauants you want to eat at, e.t.c....Over all, we are very happy with it. This will be our spot for SF from now on...
