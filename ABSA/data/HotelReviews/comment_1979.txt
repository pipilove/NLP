Loved the Radisson!

During our family trip to Australia, we stayed at 3 different hotels in Sydney (others were Hyde Park Inn and Marriott Sydney Harbor). This was our favorite. The staff were all friendly and the concierge was the best. Had room ready early as we were beat when we arrived. Try to book the buffet breakfast--it is not to be missed. Can't really explain the negative comments from a reviewer from a few weeks ago. We thought this place was top notch!
