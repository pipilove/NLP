Great Location

Just got back from a 5 night stay at the Swissotel. We picked this hotel because other reviewers said it was in a convenient location, and it was. We stayed in a standard room because we knew we were going to be out most of the day anyway. The room was decent; just don't expect any views out the window. However, it was very quiet though, which was a plus. In addition, we were able to check in at 11am after a long flight from NY. Overall, we would definitely stay here again.
