Love the Hotel, give Barcelona a miss

We stayed here for five nights in early July. We'd booked a double room but they didn't have one when we arrived. We had to change rooms the next day, which was a little frustrating. Overall we had no problems with the hotel, the rooms were very nice, the staff were helpful and spoke excellent English and the breakfasts were more than adequate. The hotel is right next to the metro station but it is only a five minute walk to La Rambla. We enjoyed Barcelona, especially the Gaudi, BUT we had a bag stolen whilst sat in the Parc de la Ciutadella. Whilst reporting this at the police station we met another couple who had their bag taken in exactly the same place. We passed this police station every day and it was amazing how many tourists were in there, at all times of the day - there is definitely a crime wave going on. If you do go, and we won't be going back, please be very careful. We were luckly and didn't lose any valuables but the other couple lost everything. And we were very careful, they are just extremely clever - we were distracted for no more than 10 seconds!
