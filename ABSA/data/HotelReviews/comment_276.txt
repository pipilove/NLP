Would Stay There Again and Again

I have been to Amsterdam a half-dozen times in the last few years, and Seven Bridges is where I will stay the next time and the time after that. The location is nearly unbeatable. The view from canal-side rooms is unbeatable. The rooms are charming, spotless and spacious. The price was right. I have paid a lot more for standard Amsterdam charmless fare, but I won't again.
