Dirty bathroom, bad service

The room - on the executive floor - could have used a good dusting. The bathroom was only partly cleaned, especially the toilet wasn't. Even after telling housekeeping about the problems, one would figure, they would give the room a very good cleaning the next day - well, that didn't happen. Just the bath tub and the sinks got cleaned, the mirror, glass partition, tiles were very obviously not. We had reserved a non-smoking room and upon check-in the receptionist confirmed the room as non-smoking. Entering the room we had to discover - it was a smoking room.People in our party asked for another room, because of the proximity to the elevator and twin beds (mentioned in the reservation) and were told very rudely that's the room we've given to you, so you have to take itThis is no 5-star hotel. But with their location and being one of the hotels in Berlin offering a great number of rooms, they think they simply don't have to work that hard.Very disappointing experience there!
