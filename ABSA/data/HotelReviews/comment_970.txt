they want payment in full, before we go!

My boyfriend and I decided on the Hotel des Grands Hommes for our trip to Paris this fall, because of all the great reviews. We contacted through email and by phone, booked our room, paid the deposit and then received an email from them asking us to pay in full for the week that we'll be there! Needless to say we won't be staying there.
