Not a great place to stay

We stayed in this hotel for one night and wished that we had stayed elswhere. First, the hotel tells you they have parking. They do not. You have to use public parking that is three blocks away and costs 50 Euros a night. The Victoria is also broken up into the original hotel and the old rundown hotel they purchased next door. They do not tell you you may have to stay in this hotel. It is the classsic bait and switch. The carpets are stained and filthy. The rooms are okay but not too clean either and the room internet rates are high even for western Europe. In addition, the breakfast is expensive for a poor and limited quality buffet . When we spoke to the manager about the problems of the hotel he said he was sorry . We told him we booked our room in the Victoria not at the hotel they purchased next door. He said that most people liked staying in the add-on hotel next door. We found this hard to believe especially considering the awful condition of this old and inferior add-on hotel. Guests should know all of these facts before choosing to book this hotel. We won't stay at this hotel in the future.
