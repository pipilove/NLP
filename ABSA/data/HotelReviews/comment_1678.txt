Wanted to love it - but inconsistent.

We stayed here for four nights and while some things were positively brilliant, other things really disappointed. The art and photography makes this place different than most, and we had a look at the photos on a few different floors just to appreciate it. We did have to laugh as the content of much of the work is quite adult -- no problem with us, but we seen details of a 'children stay free' promotion and thought it might have been a bit of a challenge in that instance. I am sure the artwork in various rooms makes this just fine, however.Other positives for us: we ate in the restaurant twice - once for dinner and once for breakfast - and had an excellent experience both times. (And if you don't fancy their breakfast, Top Pot Donuts  Coffee is a nice little walk away and far nicer than the gazillion chain shops you'll pass on the way.) Very nice beds  bedding. Elevator seemed to be set to never stop on the way, which provided it isn't busy, is cool. Not once did I have to feel guilty because there wasn't room for someone else due to my luggage.Some days, very attentive and friendly staff on the door. The disappointments: when we checked in, we were sent to a room that was still occupied. It wasn't as awkward as it could have been, and we were quickly given a new room, but the experience was a bit worrying. Parking is a general problem in downtown Seattle -- the hotel has secure, valet-only parking for $25 a day, or there is a pay lot directly across the street that could be a little cheaper if you wanted to feed meters and pay each time you move the car. Some days, the staff on the door didn't acknowledge our presence, whether we needed help or not.I totally dig what they want to be...I guess I just thought for the price we paid that it would actually live up to it. Some days yes, other days not at all.
