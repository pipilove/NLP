Excellent, but has faults

The Hotel Royal Magda Paris is a very quaint hotel in an excellent part of Paris. It is approx 5 min saunter to the Le Arc De Triomphe and the famous Champs Elysees. There are some excellent bars and restaurants in the area and if you are travelling from Ireland through Beauvais it is about â‚¬10 in a taxi to the drop off point. But there is one draw back to the hotel and that is one of the rooms is located next to a very busy restaurant / bar (Room 115) avoid this room or bring sleeping tablets. The breakfast is over priced as you will get similar if not better in a cafe close by. You choose sitting eating a croissant looking at the Le Arc De Triomphe or a dinning room wall for twice the price. All in all I think if I was returning I would consider staying there again taking on board the comments above.
