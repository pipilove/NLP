good for the money

We stayed in The Moore in May, 2007 for 2 nights.It was o.k. for the money.The desk people were very friendly and helped us in any way.It is an old hotel, clean, the bathroom was in our room very small.They gave us the room we asked for, topfloor with the view to the water. Very nice, but in the morning you have the traffic.We would not book in summer. No A.C.!Situation: 2 blocks from the market and 2 blocks to the downtown shops. Perfect.2 facts we didnéº“t like. - Boeing : 45 min busride, 1 hall with poor pieces, 2 videos, 1 was really poor, busride to the factory. 0.5h on  a platform to look down  Really: NOT TO DO - the bar in the Moore: rough. The elder lady was nice, but the  next evening, the younger ( not young ! ) one, very unpleasant!!The MOORE is good for the money, but NOT in summer.Rh.
