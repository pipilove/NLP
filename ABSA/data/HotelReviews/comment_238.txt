Not good!

We stayed here for 5 nights over easter and I wish we had stayed at home. The rooms are very very small. You could shower while sat on the toilet. Compact is an understatement. Cleaniness also seems to be lacking. In fact we changed rooms as in the first room I awoke to be COVERED in flea bites, disgusting, Second room was better. It was at the front of the hotel. Still very small and not practical bathroom. Not for us I'm afraid.
