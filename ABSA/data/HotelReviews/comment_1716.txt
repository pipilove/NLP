Great Alternative to Downtown  

 We really liked the Silver Cloud. Our room was exceptionally clean and comfortable. Much bigger than other Seattle hotel rooms I have stayed in, too.The free parking is a huge plus. This saves you about $32/day over Seattle hotels. It seemed quite secure, but was still very easy to access.A good selection of nice, waterfront restaurants and bars are within walking distance, and the hotel offers a free shuttle to downtown. A taxi to anywhere in the city would be pretty cheap, too. Seattle Center (Space Needle, EMP).The only thing I didn't like about the hotel was that, while our room looked at the water, it was separated from Lake Union by Eastlake Drive, a busy road. Our room (on floor 7) was pretty quiet, even with the traffic and regular seaplane departures. The blackout drapes were a huge plus.I would definitely consider the Silver Cloud Lake Union next time I'm in Seattle. Its not only a good value, but a very nice place to stay and a good homebase from which to explore the city.
