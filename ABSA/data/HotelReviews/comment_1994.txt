Comfortable, great location, good stay

Stayed for 2 nights with the family. rm was a good size  bathrm was great. Separate shower  the water was powerful! Very comfy bed. Good lighting in room - not like some of the dimly lit hotels these days. Turn down service is offered , u just hve to call housekeeping(they actually put a note out telling u this). Great full lenght mirror, hair dryer they provide is powerful, plug adapter in the room. Free internet acess in lobby . room we stayed in was parkside and on checkout I queried the reception  said I could hardly see the park. He explained it is NOT park VIEW but park SIDE versus the lower catogory city side -- so I guess I'll just get the city side next time as he said the rms are the same but approx AUS$40 less. Restaurant service very average- seems everyone is a trainee.Vacated rm @1400hrs  bags stored at Bell captain's. Paid bill @ 1900hrs  left for airport. On arriving airprt saw I was missing a hand carry bag that I left in the room. Called hotel, they found it  handled my call very well. But I wondered why housekeeping had not contacted the front desk and given my bag to them rather then send it straight to lost property. As I did vacate rm at 1400hrs. Bit of inter department communication needed here.
