Great location but not great value for money.

I chose this hotel because of the convenient location, across from Amsterdam Centraal. The lush, decadent exterior and entrance hall are not however, carried on into the bedroom. My room is small and boxy. The mattress is so firm I may be better sleeping on the floor, yet the pillows are so soft I may risk suffocation during the night.Check in was efficient.I ate at a bistro round the corner (near Soup Kitchen which I know from previous trips is great for wholesome food) rather than in the hotel because the screaming child put me off even looking at the menu.Location is excellent, en suite is nice, bedroom is small, staff are helpful. I wouldn't rush back though, so I'll try somewhere else next time I am in Amsterdam.
