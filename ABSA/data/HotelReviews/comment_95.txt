Worst hotel stay I ever had

This hotel was listed as a 5 star (on priceline.com)? I have travelled quite a bit and stayed at a range of hotels. This hotel rates worse than 2 and 3 star hotels i have stayed at; in Amsterdam and throughout Europe and Middle East. The only good thing that can be said about this hotel is the location. Other than that, this hotel is very dirty. The room smelled terribly. It has not been updated in decades. Stains all over the furniture and comforters. My wife would not remove her shoes. After the first night, I checked out and stayed elsewhere, incurring a loss.I was absolutely amazed that people could write anything positive about this place, or even pay top dollar to stay here.
