Service to the MAX

I spent 3 nights at the Hotel Max in September 06, and found the service and attentiveness of the staff to be excellent. I had checked Trip Advisor prior to booking, so I booked an Artist King room for myself, which I found to be a nice size. The bathroom would be short on shelf space for 2 people, but that depends on how much you unpack.The everpresent, friendly door staff add to the pleasure of the lobby and the funky decor to make you feel welcome. Yes, hotel rooms in downtown Seattle are smaller, and I wouldn't be keen to stay in smaller than I had, but the location is fantastic, staff friendly, decor is cool and the asian restaurant is quite good (they do a great burger if you don't like sushi type food).
