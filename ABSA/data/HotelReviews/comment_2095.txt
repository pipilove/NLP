Don't believe what you are told

About a month ago I booked two Jamison Club rooms so that my my wife would have somewhere pleasant to stay in Sydney to celebrate her 40th birthday with her sisters. I booked 2 x twin rooms (that is, two double beds in each room). Two days before the check-in date, a friendly member of the hotel staff called me to confirm my reservation of TWO JAMISON CLUB TWIN ROOMS. Also, having previously read some posts on tripadvisor regarding difficulties in obtaining parking at the hotel, I called the hotel the day before check-in to find out whether there would be any problem obtaining valet parking. I was told It won't be a problem at all because the hotel will be just about empty. Upon arriving at the hotel, two of the sisters that drove to the hotel were advised that valet parking was not available and that they would have to drive a block away to get parking. In addition, upon check-in, my wife was told that only one twin room was available and that the other would have to be a Deluxe King room (1 x king bed). These two significant failings are unacceptable, particularly because this hotel claims to be 5-star. Apart from these problems, the rooms were fine and represent good value.
