Great location but a bit tired

Great location just off Sydney harbour, but the hotel is a bit tired and in need of refurbishment. We found service poor and were kept waiting for rooms after the 3.00pm check in time. Be warned about the lift situation, they are being refurbished and one of them is permanently out of action. This means at peak times you can be kept waiting for 15 minutes or more and when you do get one they are scarily packed. We liked the look of the Observatory.
