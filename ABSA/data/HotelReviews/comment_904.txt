Fantastic Hotel with Great Service

I just returned from Paris on the 12th. I stayed at George V two nights. I enjoyed every minute of my stay. The hotel is located in the 8th arrondisement (district) on Avenue George V. It is about a block from the Champs Elysees. My room was a little smaller than I anticipated, but it came with all the accoutrements of a room at a luxury hotel, including a full-size umbrella. That really came in handy since it rained both nights of my stay. There are Bulgari toiletries in the bathroom, a large terry cloth bathrobe and terry cloth slippers. The bed is something else!! It's like sleeping on a cloud. There is a down mattress pad on the bed, and you just sink in it. The pillows are fluffy and comfortable. There is this wonderful smell in the room due to a sachet in the closet. The first night at the hotel you can leave your shoes outside your room and they will shine them, complimentary, and leave them for you before you leave the next morning. They wrap them in tissue paper. It's such a nice touch. I arrived early and had to wait a few minutes for my room to be ready. I was seated in the dining/lobby area. I was about to put my purse on the floor when a young lady brought over a stool and put my purse on it. I was given complimentary tea and biscuits and a Herald Tribune while I waited. I was allowed to check in early at no extra charge.There is turn down service each night. There were truffles and a bottle of Evian water in my room when I arrived. I ate breakfast there one morning. It was almost 50 euros. I only had crepes, ham, and American coffee. That was a bit too expensive for me. There is an Hediard store next door. Louis Vuitton is a few steps away. There are too many restaurants and shops nearby to mention. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone who doesn't mind paying for luxury.
