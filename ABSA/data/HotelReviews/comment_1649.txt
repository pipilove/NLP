Dont stay here if you want to sleep!

Dont stay here if you want to sleep! The buzz words at this hotel are whatever, whenever and that applies to the guests' attitudes as well. It is a party hotel and the guests who want to party, have fun, while the other guests grit their teeth. We stayed here for 3 nights in December 2005 and had one night of rest. The other 2 nights we had a group of guests in rooms around us who stayed up, with the music on, until 5 am. I called security several times and they did settle down each time for short periods but then they would start up again, talking, laughing, slamming doors. I will never stay in a W Hotel again. And the coffee at the hotel was the pits. In the city of coffee they should have at least got this right. Too cool for school is what I think it is all about with this stylish joke of a hotel. Shame on you.ct
