Small rooms, old, there is better value in Sydney

We did not like the hotel at all, we would give it 3 1/2 at max. The entrance area might be impressive and location is great but rooms were old and not up to date, we felt like travelling in the early 90s. We think there is better value for equivalent rates, for example the Quay West Suites.
