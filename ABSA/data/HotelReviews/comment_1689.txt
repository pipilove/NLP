Great location

we stayed here two nights in Aug. and found it to be a great location, and nice hotel. The rooms were a bit small, and the bathroom was very small. No bath, just a shower. Other than that, there was nothing to complain about. Clean, and funky decor. We walked everywhere downtown, the location is perfect for someone who wants to see the Seattle hot spots. We got a great deal at travelzoo.com, not sure what the normal rates are.
