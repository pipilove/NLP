Hilton Berlin - It's fine...

We stayed at the Hilton for two nights at the beginning of December. The hotel is well place in the city, with a U-Bahn station right outside the door; this makes everywhere very easily accessible. We were also right next to one of the Christmas markets, which was handy. The hotel itself is fine; it is a fairly typical four star hotel, without any features to really set it apart from the rest. The lobby is grand in it's size, and is quite impressive. We were given a smoking room, and the staff were happy to move us to a less smelly non-smoking room when we asked. Throughout the stay the hotel staff were all very helpful and polite, and of course all spoke excellent English - as usual compounding my misery at being uni-lingual!Our room was clean and of a good size and the bathroom was very nice. The minibar was well stocked and priced at the usual OTT rate! The swimming pool and gym were both excellent, although I still cannot quite believe they charge 11 Euros for a Sauna... Breakfast was excellent, with a very good selection of food and very good service. The hotel restaurants looked nice, but we did not try them. Probably my main criticism with the hotel is it's size - the hotel is very big and somewhat impersonal. Checking out at 10.55 on Sunday was not a good plan, as all six queues for reception were enormous - this could of course have been avoided by getting up earlier or doing express check out. The last time we stayed in Berlin (June), we stayed at the Ritz Carlton  paid a similar price to the Hilton; on our next visit we will certainly go back to the Ritz Carlton, as it is that bit more special.
