Great Hotel

Picked Omni from previous reviews... Some may say being on edge of financial district is quiet, well No! We experienced a Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Saturday was very quiet to get going as most local deli's etc within 10 min walk either do not open on Saturday or open later, say 10am which is fine. It is only 10 min walk from Ferry Building which has many cafes etc and markets at the weekend. Or just hop on cable car that goes past hotel and get off further up California Street to jump on cable car down to Union Square, 15 mins tops. Loads of places to eat there. The cable cars are great, get a $11 dollar all day ticket from hotal reception, valid for the cars and buses. Rooms are lovely, nice and big and great bathrooms, all marble, rooms have air con big TV , video games etc.We used as base to explore, Lombard street, G Gate bridge, Fishermans Wharf, Italian quarter, Coit Tower. Most is easily walkable but those hills can be pretty steep so the cable cars really do make it easy. One tip though.... it can be better to go the end of the line/terminus to get a car and join the queue as some are very busy and nobody gets off, hence you can wait at a stop and not get on at all. Busiest route is from the Market to Fishermansd Wharf via Hyde Street. This one passes over Lombard Street just by the 'crooked street' bit. Great fun standing on the side and leaning out.... which you are not supposed to do of course. We did have one evening meal in the Bob's Steakhouse, attached to hotel and one brealfast. Very good quality although a bit more expensive. Very very busy during the week with business people etc. The bar gets very crowded and noisy but in a nice happy, people enjoying themseleves sort of way.All the staff were very polite and extremely helpful, whatever the question is.
