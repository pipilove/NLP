Best Radisson

I've Stayed In This hotel from it's spacious and tasteful rooms to the great breakfast to the wonderful staff was one of the best hotel experiences I have had.Check in was quick and we were able to get in at 10am. The staff were courteous and helpful (although in Australia this seems to be the norm). Our room was great!! The Concierge helped in booking a few tours and they really went above and beyond even exceeding my expectations. They noticed that we were out late clubbing and probably wouldn't like to go early so they arranged afternoon tours and even had the items sent to our room and placed under the door as not to disturb us. All of the staff were great but I if you can get Darren at the concierge to help you out, he's the best.I will for sure stay at this hotel again if I am in Sydney and would highly recommend it to anyone.
