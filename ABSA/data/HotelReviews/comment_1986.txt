Stay at the Hyatt!

I stayed here using my hotel loyalty points (as I did at the Park Hyatt afterwards) and the experience could not have been more different. The Sheraton is a beautiful hotel with large rooms and luxurious bathrooms, but that's it. The service is indifferent and you feel an inconvenience by daring to ask for anything. At the Hyatt you are made to feel like royalty, and nothing is too much trouble. Saturday morning I asked concierge for a late dinner reservation for that night at a restaurant with a view of the harbour. I stated a preferred location, and dietary preferences  said if full please try any others so that we have somewhere to go for dinner. I left my cellphone number and received no call, and returning to the hotel at 6ish, discovered they had made no reservation at all. Call that service? - I certainly don't! Another member of staff eventually found us somewhere to dine.For my money (and next time I visit Sydney on business) I will stay at the Hyatt no question.
