A Little Disappointing ...

After reviewing your site for this hotel, I duly booked for my husband, myself and four friends to stay here for a four-night break.Our flight from the UK was 5 hours late so we didn't arrive at the hotel until 12.30am. The staff were very friendly and helpful but the hotel itself had obviously seen better days! Our friends were placed on the first floor whereas my husband and myself were on the fourth floor {why do hotels put people travelling together at opposite ends of the hotel??}.Our room was very small and cramped [as expected from information given here] but the carpet was stained and dirty and the bedspread was made of a nylon material - also with dirty marks and stains. The wardrobe had 5 hangers and enough space to hang a few items of clothes. So we did not unpack our cases for the duration of our stay as we had nowhere to hang them.Breakfast was typically French and adequate but the limited choices offered made each successive day less appealing. We have become accustomed in Spain, Germany and the UK to a large selection of cheeses, meats, yoghurts, fruit, bacon etc. and the lack of this choice made breakfast very predictable and - for me - unappetising!I loved the area. Shops, restaurants and cafes abound. I think though next time, we'd look for a slightly better hotel in the same area.
