Just okay at the Alsterhof

Location is fine, place is clean, and no problems with the bathroom, but oh that postage-stamp bed for two ... and when we asked the next day to be moved to a room with either twins or a decent-sized bed, we were told that the hotel was full up. I'm ambivalent about staying here again. I got a much better deal at the Marriott Potsdamer Platz on a previous trip. Sure, the Alsterhof is in a great location, but I liked the nice big king-sized bed at the Marriott, and both are convenient to Berlin's extensive public transport. If I ever book the Alsterhof again, I'll be sure to ask for a decent bed!
