Location Great! Experience Fantastic. What a great hotel!

The staff were excellent, very helpful. They knew they're city and enough english to direct us were we needed to go. The hotel is located just five minutes from the Columbus statue which is a great hub to catch transportation to any part of the city.The roof top wadding pool and excercise room are small but we spent most of our time exploring the city. The rooms are spacious and clean. Everything was very modern and I would stay there again anytime I'm in Barcelona.
