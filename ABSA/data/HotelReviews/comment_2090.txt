Service is something that other hotels do!

Poor check-in, unfriendly staff, didn't clean room well, 3 days without replenishing the mini-bar, complained and nothing improved. Poor location for getting a taxi, especially on a Friday night and don't expect much from the concierge or front desk staff who are too important and busy to concern themselves with their guests' welfare.Not worth the room rate. Starting to look a bit shabby in certain areas including the rooms.Room service food quality was quite poor. Breakfast elsewhere would have been a better option.I can't think of anything particularly positive to say about the hotel other than writing an awful review of it gives me some pleasure!
