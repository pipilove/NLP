Excellant room with average service.

We arrived at the Four Seasons 1 hour ahead of the check-in time of 3.pm on the slim chance that a room would be available. Please come back in an hour,we did and the room still was not ready?The piano was playing and the doors were being opened but the basic service was not available. We finally obtained our room after another 15 minutes with our bags to follow. After waiting 1.5 hours we still had not received our bags. Called reception your bags are top priority Sir, 20 minutes later they arrived?After these experiences we did not try the meals etc.but opted to eat out. We tried The Waterfront (excellent service  food) and The Italian Village(excellent service  food), both are located a short walk (150 metres) from the Four Seasons just past the Overseas Shipping Terminal.The Opera House View room was excellent with 2 windows, 1 with Opera House  1 with city views. Plenty of room with king size bed,lounge, table, fridge,robes T.V cabinet etc. The bathroom was huge ( 'L shaped ) with a separate vanity area,huge bath, fantastic shower, fluffy towels,robe  slippers .The room was meant to be non-smoking but had ashtrays?Overall the location and facility is excellent just the service is uncoordinated.
