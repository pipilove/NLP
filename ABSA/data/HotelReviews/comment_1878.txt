Great Location

We stayed here for 4-5 nights in December. The hotel was completely full. When we arrived, they assigned us a room type that we had not booked. Unfortunately it was the only room available that night. However, after we spoke to the manager, they did move us first thing the next morning. The room was nice, very clean with a nice bathroom.The location of the hotel was great. We were right next to Darling Harbor and all of the restaurants there (King Street Wharf, I think). The hotel was also very close to the shopping mall (I forget the name, maybe it was very Victoria). Chinatown was nearby also, along with an IMAX theater. We mostly walked around Sydney and took cabs or the bus occasionally. It was about a twenty minute walk to the Sydney Harbor bridge and Opera House area. Even though the hotel is primarily business oriented, the concierge was very helpful with all of our touristy requests. In fact, the concierge service was excellent. They booked our Bridge Climb for us, gave us any number of options for our trip to the Blue Mountains, made wonderful suggestions for meals and made all of our reservations for everything, despite the fact that we noticed very few people asking them for touristy help. The people at the tour desk were very friendly and very honest with their recommendations and advice.Internet access at the hotel was very expensive, but the area convenience stores offer internet access within a few blocks of the hotel.
