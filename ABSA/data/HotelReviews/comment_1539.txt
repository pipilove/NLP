The rudest people ever - dont stay!!!!!!

Despite the fact that this could be a very cool hotel, the place sucks. The front desk, one of the nights we were there, was run by one of the rudest people I have ever met. I will not name him, but when we had a problem with our room, he was extremely rude and would not hear our issue. Very, very dissapointed.
