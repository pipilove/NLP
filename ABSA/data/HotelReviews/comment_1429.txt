Nice Hotel, but Bad enviorment!

This was a very nice hotel. Convienent location, clean, nice staff and decent service. The only problem I ran into was, no one knew anything at the helpdesk. We asked how far a restaurant was from the hotel and if it was walking distance. They told us it was a 8 to 10 minute walk. As we were walking to the restaurant, we noticed that we had been walking for a good 20 minutes. On top of that it was extremely cold outside. We were very upset with the poor judgement of the hotel's help desk. There since of direction is VERY poor, so if you don't know where you are going, find out before you stay at this hotel. The area of the hotel is REALLY shady. Homeless people on every singel corner harrassing you at any second they get. I was surprised that a women at the front desk gave directions using the back door, then told me to ignore what ever is happening outside that door. Outside that door was serval homeless people sitting on the stairs bothering bypasser's. If you want to stay in a quiet, nice area, I suggest you stay in Nobb Hills!
