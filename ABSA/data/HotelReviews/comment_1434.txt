Still suffering

Had to check in 3 times, staff were unable to competently check people in to rooms, heard at least 2 people complain that the valet had lost their car and then we were double charged for the room. When hotel was contacted they claimed I had not been charged even though I could show them it on my statement!! Then claimed I had said ok to a $20 fee for a room with a view even though I never had.This has been on going and they still have not resolved it. If you dont like your money, your car or good customer service, this is the place to go, otherwise stay in one of the nearby hotels. They are nicer, just as cheap and dont ruin your trip.
