My husband and I stayed here on the last leg of our honeymoon in France. This hotel was excellent. The room was a little small but it had a balcony and it was nice to sit out there. The bed was extremely comfortable, it called us every afternoon to take a nap. The hotel was very clean and I loved the updated decor. The staff were the most polite and friendly staff we encountered during our whole 2 week trip. The location is very close to the Arch de Triomphe. There are also many metro stops close by. I preferred the first hotel we stayed at (Hotel De Varenne) only because the location was better and it was easier to walk to many attractions. We did not have breakfast because like many other hotels, it was a bit pricey and it's better and cheaper to grab something on the street.
