Nice overall, but beds had me begging for 4-star

Things we loved: The view, the security in that only keyed guests have access to parking garage and rooms building, the staff is friendly, the shuttle is an OUTSTANDING service, free parking, the breakfast is decent and convenient, the room is quiet, the bathroom was exceptionally clean, maid service is great and we never had to shuffle around carts (they worked when we weren't there), all in all a great value.Things we hated: The beds. And while I loved EVERYTHING about the hotel otherwise, I can't sleep on crummy beds. There was a smell coming from the headboards perhaps b/c they were new, which gave me migraines every night, so, after 3 nights of this misery, we had to check out and go somewhere else in town for the rest of our 8-9 day trip. My husband also had a migraine, which he's never had before, and my kids acted a little berzerko at bedtime (which was highly unusual), so I think the fume eminating from the headboard and nightstand was toxic. Possibly formaldehyde which is found in particle board. So, if you have sensitivities, allergies, what have you, you might want to stay somewhere else. Sad to me b/c otherwise the place is really quite nice! *P.S. The migraine experience would start when we'd come back for naps in the afternoon, and then would not relent, so I missed dinner a couple of nights, and if we did go out I would feel good, but then come back for bedtime and feel awful again. So I KNOW it was those beds. Sniff.
