W is a disappointment

We booked this hotel through American Express and received an upgrade to a corner room. The hotel attempts to be cool and edgy by refusing to light the lobby or hallways to a sufficient level. Our room was an Asian inspired minimalist decor which I did appreciate but the furniture lacked sturdiness and had seen better days. I was more disappointed in the service aspects of the hotel than in the room itself. Our room had no directory of hotel services and the front desk did not understand why we were requesting such information. The room service menu was uninspired and expensive. In Seattle on a Sunday evening after 9 p.m. room service was our only option. The general unfriendliness of the hotel staff was apparent.Three of the four days of our stay we had to call and request housekeeping clean our room because it was past 4 p.m. and no one had been in to clean the room. This hotel puts too much emphasis on branding and not enough on guest comfort. It is way overpriced for the facilities and services offered.
