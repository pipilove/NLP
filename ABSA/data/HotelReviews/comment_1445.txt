First Time in San Francisco - great choice of hotel

I'm so delighted that I opted for the Renaissance Parc 55 for my first ever visit to San Francisco.We arrived v early on a flight from Vegas as we needed to cram in a full day's sight-seeing in SF. Took a taxi to the hotel and expected to have to dump our bags and come back later to check-in. But to my pleasant surprise, we were able to check-in around 8.30am at no extra charge. Receptionist was lovely as were the porters - v helpful with recommendations.Dashed out for our trip to Alcatraz followed by a city bus tour. Finally crashed back at hotel later in day. Room was very comfortable and clean and quite high - 14th floor? Felt a bit dizzy at the window!Went to visit friends in the evening so didn't get a chance to use other facilities in the hotel. Picked up a hire car in the morning - didn't realise there was a Hertz desk in the hotel which would have been v handy - had arranged to pick up car at Westin St Francis. Brought car back to hotel where a bunch of porters attempted to load myself, 2 seniors and 8 pieces of luggage into a Ford Mustang convertible. They deserve an award for patience and for ability to re-configure the contents so we all fitted in!! They seemed very concerned about us leaving SF and driving to LA!!I'd booked through Octopus Travel on the web and got a great deal but I would pay more next time if necessary to stay there as the staff and hotel are worth it!
