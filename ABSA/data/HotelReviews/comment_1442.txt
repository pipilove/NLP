Awesome Hotel with a couple quirks

When I transferred to San Francisco, my company put me in the Parc 55 Hotel for 20 days. For 20 days, you'd better like the place you're staying! And it turns out, I did! The location is perfect. Parc 55 is located right on Market Street, across from the best mall I've ever been to (Westfield). It's like Vegas for shoppers. The actual hotel is really nice. My room had an amazing view of the Grace Cathedral and the sunsets were priceless. The room was very clean and the staff was amazing. The only issue I really had was with the internet - $12.95 a day and no wireless. Not having a wireless connection was a huge inconvenience. Also, most hotels I stay at offer internet free of charge. After 20 days, this expense was pretty painful. As someone who works in the tech industry, I will definitely look for this the next time I book a hotel.
