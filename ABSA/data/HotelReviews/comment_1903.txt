Nice stay

We stayed at the Four Points on a Saturday night. The room was nice, the view was great, staff very friendly and helpful, and the breakfast the next morning was lovely. The hotel is in a great position only a short walk to King Street wharf and the Aquarium. The only complaint was the sounds coming from the pipes after we got back to our room around midnight. We called the front desk and they came up to our room immediately. They thought it may be next door's shower and couldn't do anything about it. The noise eventually stopped after about 45 minutes.
