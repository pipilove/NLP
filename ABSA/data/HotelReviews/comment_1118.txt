A Taste of Paris

My family of 4 (2 adults, 13 year old and 10 year old) spent 4 wonderful nights at Hotel Residence Foch. On arriving by train at a metro stop in close proximity to the hotel, we had no difficulties finding Hotel Residence Foch which is situated in a very quiet and safe neighbourhood within walking distance from the Arc de Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower. On the first night, Nellie spent time highlighting major sites to visit and helped us to prepare a comprehensive itinerary for the duration of our stay. Whilst I had spent time preparing an itinerary prior to leaving Australia, it was most helpful to have input from a resident. Nellie and her staff are friendly and very accommodating. I required a doctor on arrival and the reception staff promptly organised for the doctor to visit. Afterwards, we explored the area near the Hotel and also headed to the Eiffel Tower to view the lights on dusk - spectacular. Our spacious room was very suitable for our family. It consisted of two rooms partitioned by a heavy curtain with a very clean large bathroom. The decor was very tasteful. After busy days, visiting museums, riding on Hop On Hop Off buses and eating in exquisite French restaurants, it was wonderful to arrive back to Residence Foch to rest and be restored for the next day.We all enjoyed the breakfast buffet. We also purchased cold meats from the local butcher, French cheeses from the Deli and delectable treats from the pastry shop which we ate in the foyer of Residence Foch.The free internet was also great - my two children had the opportunity to communicate with their friends in Australia.Hotel Residence Foch is definately a safe and suitable place to stay with a family. Thank you, Nellie and the Team
