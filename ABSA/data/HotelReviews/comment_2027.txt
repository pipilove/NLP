Excellent stay

We booked this hotel the day before arriving not sure what to expect because the rooms were really cheap. The hotel was excellent! The reception staff were chatty and helpful, the room was large and good sized bathroom.We had a slight problem with our TV and called reception and someone came and ficed it 5 minutes later.No complaints with this hotel! Excellent stay and excellent location to see all of the sights in Sydney. I would 100% stay here again.
