Disappointing Swissotel

We just spent 4 days last weekend in the Swissotel Berlin. Like previous reviewers, this hotel doesn't deserve the 5star ranking accredited to it. Overall, the service at the reception was good, and the breakfast was sumptuous. However, there was no turn-down service, even after we have requested for it after the first night. In addition, the acclaimed fitness and wellness center was a disappointment. The gym feels so clostophobic as there were no windows at all. Also, the lavazza coffee machine in our room didn't work at all. Overall, I think it is only worth a 4* rating - thus, I would not pay anything beyond a 4* price for it.
