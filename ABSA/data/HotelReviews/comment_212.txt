Amazing View

We stayed here with our two girls (6 and 4 years old). The view of Westerkerk was worth the price of the hotel room.The staff was very kind and friendly, esp. to the children. The shower was close to the toilet and all the beds were twin size, but part of the fun of traveling is learning to accommodate to another country's standards. We would definitely stay here again.
