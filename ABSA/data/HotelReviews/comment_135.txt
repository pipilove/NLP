Amersdam Victoria - Nice and Comfortable But Can Be Better

Stayed at the Amsterdam Victoria for 4 nights during our Benelux holiday in Aug 2003. We were attracted by the good location (only steps from the main train station) and the good price that we got on the internet. The hotel does look old both from the outside and inside. This was compensated by decent service, polite receptionists and comfortable rooms. But it's high time the management renovate the hotel.
