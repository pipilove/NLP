Great value in Seattle

Myself and spouse stayed at the Warwick Seattle for four days in September. This hotel does not disappoint as a reasonably priced stay in the downtown area. It's an easy walk to all sightseeing attractions (five blocks from the waterfront) and there is a free bus in Seattle but we could never figure out how that worked (do some research before you go!!). Our room (king bed) was spacious and nicely appointed, very comfortable and with plenty of pillows. The coffee in the room of course was great (this being Seattle). The bath is finished in marble with a deep tub and hand-held shower which was a nice touch. Toiletries were below average but that's not a huge consideration for us. Our only complaints concerned the front desk. I had made two reservations: one for the first part of our trip and one for the third leg (after Olympic Penninsula) but decided to cancel the second reservation. When we arrived at the hotel after a full day of travel the desk clerk kept us waiting for several minutes without so much as a hello. We moved to the second desk clerk when she was free and were told that our reservation could not be found. No attempt was made to look for it. We had to walk up the stairs to the parking garage and get our confirmation from our luggage and only then did they find the reservation. The following day my office tried to call and was told that we weren't staying there. Parking is $21/day which is pretty steep but the only option because parking in Seattle is scarce. The hotel doesn't have a shuttle so the only other option was a cab which is about $30.The hotel restaurant is adequate but for a really great breakfast walk a block to the Mayflower Park Hotel (pricey but fabulous).
