Bugs.... ugh

While this hotel is ideally situated, and have a reasonable staff. There is a wide disparity between the newer and older rooms. I was placed in an older room that did not have working cable television, adequate heating, and had a shabby old worn out feel to it. The worst part was when I arrived after a long day in PAris, and was told mt things were moved, because of little bugs. Well, as a result of whatever was in that hotel, I have been covered in very iitchy lesions all over my body. For my discomfort, I was given a newer room in the back rather than the room with the view I had before, free beakfasts, and a discount (which I asked for). The discount they gave me amounted to 1/20th of my hotel stay, and was done with very little grace. I couldnt leave the hotel because I was there with a large group, so their poor treatment was even more pronounced. SCabies really really itch, and are a pain to get rid of. Be careful at this hotel.
