The property is very beautiful and has fabulous common areas and yes, breakfast is fantastic - esp outside in the courtyard. The people who serve breakfast are really nice - great service.The location really isn't that great compared to other Paris 6/7 properties. It's on a non-descript side street that leads into another non-descript side street that is then off a busy avenue or two - it is near St. Sulpice but there are hotels that are closer to the Seine, the heart of St. Germain and the Luxembourg gardens.It is very expensive for what you get - we booked a suite and what qualified as a suite was pretty funny even for Paris standards - it was basically a large room but with enough space for two chairs and a desk. We frequently stay at another nearby hotel that really provides a suite for a similar price to what we paid.Service (breakfast) was great but I agree with comments about reception. In particular there was a gentleman with no hair and glasses (the only one) who was downright rude to us. They won't win any service awards.
