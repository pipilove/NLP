Nice hotel

The Savoy is a very nice hotel with antique furniture but still a kind of trendy look. Rooms are very spacious but most bathrooms are in urgent need of remodelling (the existing ones are dating back to the 60s!). The staff is very friendly and efficient. The only real downside of this hotel is its bar: It is a cigar bar and there are always some people inside smoking cuban cigars which makes the air inside unbearable. Sometimes, the smoke is drifting through the lobby and makes the whole place very unpleasant. There is no non-smoking section in the bar and quite frankly, if you are not a smoker yourself, it is better to avoid the bar. They do serve drinks upon request in the lobby and you better ask them to do so. Breakfast is great.
