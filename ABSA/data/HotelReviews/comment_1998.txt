very disappointed with service

Location for this hotel is great but the service and attention was not Shereton. I travelled woth my 4 year old son off a long haul flight from UAE. On arrival room not ready and proceeded to hit me up for another night accomodation. Room service, telephone calls cost were over the top and inacceptable.Asked for my breakfast be be delivered to my room as my son was ill from the flight..wouldnt do that so it took my son to vomit on their restaurant floor to get some attention. This hotel is a business Hotel mon-fri deal not for international travellors or anyone that expects some service and attention (yes most of us). I am very disappointed as I am originally from Sydney.Did I complain well yes but it fell on typical Australian deaf ears. Suggestion..try Hilton !
