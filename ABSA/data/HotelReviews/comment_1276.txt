Save your money for a real san francisco experience

My husband and I travel to San Francisco frequently. We usually stay in small hotels unique to the city. This time, along with a family member, we were traveling for a medical treatment. I chose this hotel based on reviews and location and reserved two rooms for two nights. When my surgery was cancelled and I called the hotel to see if we could make an adjustment as only my husband and myself needed one room for one night, all they could say was well, you have to pay for both rooms for both nights. No offer to try to rent the rooms. When we arrived and suggested that at least we could donate the rooms to a city agency for the needy, they were horrified and insisted that we should let them rent the rooms. One was rented for one night for half price. This hotel has a 72 hour cancellation policy which is self-serving and punitive. They appear to only care about tourists who are making one trip to San Francisco and to have no interest in cultivating follow-up business. Further, it turns out that this establishment is not a hotel but an aging standard motel. I recommend that tourists skip this place and pick one of the city's charming small hotels for a real San Francisco experience.
