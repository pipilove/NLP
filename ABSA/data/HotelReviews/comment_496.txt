Excellent rooms and great location

Great location : easy to get to the cityHotel rooms (standard double bed) were perfect, huge beds and the usual: TV, bath, bidet (perfect for cooling cava bottles), hairdryer. We were offered to upgrade but we didnt. We were on the 3rd floor (1st floor of rooms), view wasnt great but since we were out mst of the day didnt matter much. View from the 23rd floor is amazing , although we didnt eat there (student budget). We had breakfast in our rooms having bought previously things from the supermarket at the bottom of the Hotel.We used the SPA facilities, and would definitly recommend them. It was quite quiet ( we went round 6pm) and they are clean , no real pool so wouldnt recommend the Hotel for a family with small children if a swimming pool is a necessity. there is a small heated pool however in the SPA area which is nice to relax in.Staff was reasonably nice but have to agree with a previous review about the lack of character, slightly cold.. It did seem very buissiness and professional but again being out most of the day , was ok.We ordered food through room service, although a little dear , the food was very nice and service excellent as well.To sum it up: excellent hotel recommend it for couples, buissness men/women, for a relaxing weekend..Only annoying thing was the noise from the builders outside , but should be soon ended.
