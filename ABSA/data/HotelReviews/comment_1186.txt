Noisy if on lower levels

We paid for a deluxe room but all rooms are deluxe to my knowledge. The other superior (cheaper) room is in the outside courtyard and is quite dark. Staff were totally policy driven. We couldn't sleep due to noise from down stairs and on complaining they lied by saying they had no other rooms left then eventually that we could move higher but would need to pay more. Our room looked like a disabled room with chips in the plaster. Staff chant bonjour with the most insincere smile you could imagine and were quite patronising. Our only experience with this attitude in Paris was unfortunately from this hotel. On the positive- the location was great. Recommend dont getting a cheap deal over the net as they will make you feel like you are not worthy of being there. All staff are very young and obviously inexperienced.
