Satisfactory, but disappointing

We booked a three-night stay using Starpoints, arriving December 30, 2008. We arrived around 6 p.m. and had to wait about 5 minutes to check in. I am a Starwood Platinum, and I was informed that no upgrades were available because the hotel was sold out for new years eve. We were assigned a lovely garden room, room 134. The clerk did agree to include breakfast because an upgrade was not available.Later that evening, I checked the hotel's website and saw that the hotel was not sold out. There were Deluxe, Classic, and Executive rooms available for a three-night stay starting December 30. That was something of a disappointment. I cannot imagine that any of those rooms would not have been an upgrade over room 134. It was tiny. We could hear noises in the hallway, from the room above us, and from the heater. Also, the towels were ridiculously low quality for a hotel that is part of Starwood's Luxury Collection.The positives were the exceptionally comfortable bed and the breakfast. The hotel also provides use of a business center free of charge.Overall, our stay was satisfactory. However, that's not good enough for a hotel like the Pulitzer. Next time in Amsterdam, we will stay somewhere else.
