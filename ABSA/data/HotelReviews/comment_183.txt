Overbooked, no room when I arrived

I made a reservation with Hotels.com at the Banks Mansion in Amsterdam, and paid in advance with my credit card. When I arrived they told me they were overbooked and didn't have any rooms at all, even though I had prepaid. They put me in a cheaper hotel but I didn't get any refund of the price difference. The Swissotel where I had to stay instead was okay, but I saw they only charged the Banks Mansion 100 Euro, whereas I paid 150 to Hotels.com. I think it is inexcusable to overbook. It was a hassle and I did not get what I paid for.
