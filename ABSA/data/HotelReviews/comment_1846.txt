Great location for Sydney sightseeing

Stay at the Marriott for 4 nights and experienced the madness/excitement of New Years Eve, albeit with serious jetlag!!!Room had two double beds (2 adults, 2 ten year olds) and a very nice, well laid out bathroom. Breakfast was delicious. We were the jetlaggers who arrived as it opened at 7am each morning!!!! Kids loved the freshly made pancakes. Great choice, ambience and service all round.This hotel is in a prime position for sight-seeing. Walking distance to Opera house and Botanic gardens. Also The Rocks area which is amazing. Boats leaving regular from the Quay for loads of places. We went to Manly beach which was lovely. Also got bus to Bondi from nearby the hotel.Worth paying just for the location if you're on a short maybe-never-to-be-repeated visit!!! Cocktails in the lobby bar were great too - recommend!!
