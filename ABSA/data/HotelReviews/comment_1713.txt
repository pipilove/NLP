Pleasant, basic hotel

Our stay was absolutely fine - rooms were pleasant enough and very clean, breakfast buffet was typical (waffles, eggs, cereal, fruit), employees were very nice. The shuttle is a definite plus - very convenient both for trips to major areas and surprisingly quick for return trips. We had a room with a water view, but the water view is not really that great - I wouldn't make it a must have by any means. My only disappointment was that I love walking around neighborhoods and this hotel's location does not really lend itself to that.
