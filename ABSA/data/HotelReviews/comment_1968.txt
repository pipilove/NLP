Not what I had hoped for

Having read good trip adviser reviews I booked an Atrium room package on the hotel's own website. Disappointed with room, old fashioned TV with poor reception in a dark wooden noisy cabinet, all other hotels of this rating I've stayed at in Sydney at least had a plasma or LCD. View of an alleyway, not what I expected. Nice bathroom, comfy beds. Breakfast room downstairs seemed like you were eating in a cellar. Good location though, easy walk to Rocks and shopping. Would I stay again, probably not, I'd pick a hotel at The Rocks - with a decent view!
