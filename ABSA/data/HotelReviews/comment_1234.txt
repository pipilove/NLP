Excellent stay

We spent 4 nights at the Chancellor in October 2004. The rooms weren't excessively large but everything that we needed was there plus a few things that weren't needed but made the stay more fun (sweets and a rubber duck!). We were on the 5th floor at the front of the hotel but were never disturbed by road noise. The bar was comfortable and the restaurant food very good. Coffee and biscuits in the reception area were a treat. The location is ideal for exploring the city. A Muni pass is a must.
