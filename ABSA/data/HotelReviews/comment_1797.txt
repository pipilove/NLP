Excellent New Hotel

This is an excellent hotel for its price range. If you are willing to spend a lot more money for a different hotel, go ahead. But this was a good investment for what it offers. The staff was cordial, the room was clean and the furniture was chic and contemporary. And there's a Starbucks in the building for late night snacks! The Inn is just a few blocks away from the Seattle Center (Space Needle, Museums) and the Monorail, which takes you to the downtown area in a zip. Though dishes and silverware are not included in the kitchenette, you can call room service and they will promptly deliver bowls/plates/spoons/forks to your room at no cost. The rooms are small, but not claustrophobic. Overall, I had a great time at the Mediterranean Inn during my 4-night stay in Seattle. I'll definitely stay there again next time I visit that city.
