We would not recommend the Argonaut Hotel

We were rather disappointed during our recent stay. After much research we opted to stay at the Argonaut.Though a suitable hotel it certainly was not of the high caliber that we expected.The interior was a bit overboard and rather dismal.The staff was the biggest disappointment. We have stayed in hotels the world over and have never been presented with a surly staff until our stay at the Argonaut. We are not demanding guests nor are we rude so one can imagine our shock when a staff member hung up the phone during a conversation that we initiated requesting that a hair dryer in working order be sent to the room. Guest services can be a demanding career choice but if one is not up to the job at hand there are a host of career options more suitable. I think a couple of the members of the staff at the Argonaut need to contemplate their respective career choices.
