real disappointment

I was unfortunately given a really bad room. But what happened next is the real disappointment. I immediately returned to reception to request a change. I was told no changes are allowed, even though it was 3pm, and they had rooms available. This is an unspoken policy to prevent them having to check the room is still 'saleable' - I hadn't even touched the inside of the room. I avoided creating a scene, but I am writing this review so other travellers are warned. In the end, I had a terrible night with the lift apparatus and plant room humming all night. To use an Australian expression I learned - your bad luck, mate! My advice is 'avoid'
