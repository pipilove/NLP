Clean but...

Overall the hotel is very clean. There are some renovations still being done in the common areas of the lobby but it did not interfere with anything. The staff was wonderful! We had problems with the Wi-Fi, which was anything but high speed, and the whole hotel was set to heat for the winter. Our room stayed extrememly warm so we had to leave our window open all night long. The surrounding stores receive deliveries at very early hours therefore we had the noise of those deliveries come right into our room. With that, we did not get much sleep even with ear plugs! Carole at the hotel was very helpful and gave us a reduced rate for our trouble so staff was never the issue. We would not stay here again nor recommend anyone to unless the things mentioned would not concern them.
