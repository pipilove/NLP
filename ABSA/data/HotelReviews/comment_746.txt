Good value; excellent location

Stayed there a year or two back for four nights. Location is excellent - in a quiet sidestreet but very convenient for what I wanted. Just off Kurfurstendamm Strasse, within 3 minutes of Ka-De-We, within five mins of nearest S-Bahn and U-Bahn stations. Hotel was clean and staff were friendly and helpful enough. Breakfast buffet was good and plentiful. We ate out for other meals so don't know what they were like - there were a load of restaurants within a few minutes walk. Would be happy to stay here again.
