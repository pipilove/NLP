to be avoided at all costs

The only redeeming feature of this so-called 5 star hotel is the location - Dam Square - and even that in the middle of summer can be overcrowded and noisy. We arrived at 6.15 in the morning after a long flight from Ecuador, and had to wait 10 minutes until someone answered the night porter bell - not something one would expect from a 5 star hotel. Check in was fine . The room was real disappointment. Shabby , run down, and in need of a complete refurbishment. The public areas are those you would expect from a 2-3 star hotel - all again in need of a major updating. - particularly the carpets.Will never stay there again.
