2nd visit not as good as the 1st

I reviewed this hotel in Feb 08 and gave it a great review. However we experienced a number of problems this time which detracted from their previous service.We made a booking for a room with 2 beds, one for us and one for our teenager. They turned out to be very small double beds, (almost incapable of holding two grown adults), not queens which are the usual size in most upscale hotels of this category. Unfortunately they were also very uncomfortable which is strange as we have found Hyatt beds so comfortable previously we even considered buying one! Secondly our room had a connecting door to the next room. There was a lock for safety, unfortunately it didn't stop any noise which meant that we could hear every conversation, cough and pin drop next door. Thirdly when we tried to fill the bath the plug would not work and the bath drained quicker than it was filling. Unfortunately we only found this out at 11pm on our first night. After reporting it next morning it was mended before 6pm. It meant that we only had a chance to use the bath on one of our two nights stay, which was a bit of a let down.Fourthly, when we tried to arrange a later checkout they could not accommodate us. Odd as we didn't have a problem the previous time we stayed, even though we booked the room on points on both occasions.Lastly, when we went down to catch a taxi to the airport there was no porter to be seen anywhere. We were jumped on by two taxi drivers parked in the loop who ended up heatedly arguing over us in the middle of the Grand Hyatt driveway/lobby door area. Not exactly the behavior expected in a hotel of this class. A porter should be there at all times to organise transport, baggage, etc and to assist guests of the hotel We ended up walking onto the street to hail another taxi to avoid the argument.Our experience this time means we will reconsider our accommodation options during our next visit to Seattle.
