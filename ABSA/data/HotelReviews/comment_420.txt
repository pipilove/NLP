would not stay there again

This hotel has a fantastic location being near Las Ramblas but for a new modern hotel, it is extremely noisy. The rooms are very nice but with hardwood floors, you can hear people walking in the rooms above. The walls must be paper thin, because you can hear people in other rooms talking and we were right beside the elevator and it never stopped - right through the night, that elevator kept going. We put out the do not disturb sign on our door in order to have a well deserved nap in the afternoon but that did not stop the cleaners, while vacuming the hallway, of hitting our door and the walls 4-5 times while cleaning (this happened on both days we were at the hotel). Also, on the morning we left, the hotel staff would not order us a taxi for the airport until after we had checked out. This delayed us by 15 min and it was not appreciated.
