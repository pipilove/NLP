Rooms fit for a youth hostel

I checked tripadvisor before booking this. But ... where did these people stay? Certainly not in the room that we're in right now! Furniture with chipped off paint everywhere. A bis sticky spill of (I hope) Coke on the desk. There's a small door here with a tiny sticker saying: This door is locked, no minibar. hmmm. And I have not been able to locate the fridge with the free drinks. There's a coke vending machine by the lifet. Coke for 2 EUR. Certainly no free drinks. I still have the knob of the wardrobe door lying here next to ma computer. The toilet flush need lots of jiggling to stop flushing. The window opens fine but I had quite a task trying to get it back into its frame to close it again.Certainly not a hotel I would recommend. We're moving out tomorrow morning to find another hotel.
