Hated Moevenpick

Booked at the Hauptbahnhof--their service was great with the help of an American agent.But this hotel at over USD200 is the most over-priced I've ever been in. The room is the size of a walk in closet. The bathroom has translucent doors. Cleanliness is marginal. The view is terrible. It's Internet service is extremely expensive and my emails to friends were bounced back because they would not accept multiple addressees. The hotel refused to make an adjustment.Although the location is fair, the garage charges are also excessive.After having spent more than a week in Germany, from Nurnberg, Bayreuth, Dresden, Bamberg and Leipzig where we received great and gracious service, this place was the pits.The food is mediocre and expensive in an unattractive room where guests roll their baggage noisily along a walk to the elevator.There is a really cool bar next door but I would have spent a lot of time in it to make up for the deficiencies of this place.Avoid it at all costs.
