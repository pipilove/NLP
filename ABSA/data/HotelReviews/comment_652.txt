Avoid if possible

Stayed here for a conference and would not advise it for people with other options. Room was decent size for a European hotel but there were also many negatives. Furnishings were dated and floors were dirty. The hotel phone system was down for three days. Staff was rude. The front desk tried to charge me an extra day that I had cancelled upon check-in - this was a 30 minute hassle. The location is okay for but for better restaurants and sight-seeing, stay closer to Postdamer Platz or Mitte.
