Lives up to the hype!!

My wife and I booked the Hotel Montecarlo for the Barcelona stretch of our honeymoon. We booked it based on reviews from this website. We were a little nervous because the hotel is not found on very many travel sites. Bottom line: the entire experience was unforgettable - because of the room, the staff, the location and the price. I had written in advance to advise that it was our honeymoon, and they certainly stepped up to the occasion. They placed us in what they referred to as their newest and best suite. 2nd Floor with a private terrace overlooking La Rambla. seperate bedroom and sitting room. Beautiful decor, cozy kingsize bed, and the greatest bathroom you could imagine with a 2 person jacuzzi, huge seperate shower with rainfall, regular detachable showerhead and horizontal hydrotherapy jets! Double-sink vanity, etc, etc. Moments after the staff checked us in and brought up our bags, the hotel manager arrived with a complementary bottle of cava (spanish champagned) and flowers to congratulate us on the occasion. After each long, wonderful day we would sit out on our terrace with a bottle of cava and watch the excitment of La Rambla go by. Then, the moment we closed the well-soundproofed doors lowered the professionally installed black-out blinds, we were in our private villa which could have been miles from any other people. Seriously folks - This hotel was the highlight of our trip.
