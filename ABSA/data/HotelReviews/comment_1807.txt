Good location

We booked for one night as we were flying out of Sydney the next morning. Whenen we arrived at the hotel, we were told that we were upgraded to a suite from the standard room we had booked for one night. The hotel is currently undergoing remodeling, and we found that it was either directly above to next door to the upgraded room we were put in. Starting around 8am, the drills started and it was incredibly disturbing. I suppose for the majority of tourists who are out an about during the day, it's not a problem, but we were sleeping in to catch a mid afternoon flight and were unable to sleep through the noise. Additionally, our room appeared to be through some remodeling with new carpet (but missing molding on the walls), and a new bathroom with separate shower from tub, and a very large living/work space with internet access (around $0.55 per minute). There was a mid afternoon heavy rainstorm and we found one of the windows failed to have proper seals and water came into the room. It wasn't enough to flood, however, it probably damaged their walls.The location of the hotel is okay, right in Darling Harbour and in Chinatown, and close to the train station. One of the hotel restaurant/pub is currently undergoing renovation, and so there was one restaurant open and the menu looked okay though it was a bit pricey (but we found all hotel restaurant food to be pricey on our trip).We didn't have a problem with the service of staff, and check in/out was fairly easy.
