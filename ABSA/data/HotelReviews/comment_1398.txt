Great Location - Hotel room good also

This hotel is very centrally located near the Wharf and that is probably it's best selling point. The hotel itself is what you would expect from a Best Western - clean, comfortable with all the amenities. The room size was okay - we got 2 double bed, however, would have preferred a room with one king bed but they had none available. The restaurant next door was fine also - however, on the 2nd morning we went down for breakfast at 10.30 and they had stopped serving which I thought was a little early. Overall an average hotel in a great location
