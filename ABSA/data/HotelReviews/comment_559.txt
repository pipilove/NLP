Not too much to say which has not already been said, nice, clean and very enjoyable stay, would recommend this hotel very good location and service spot on.Unfortunately did not use the hotel aminities as I was out and about in Barcelona from start to finish and due to the location in the center.Great hotel and fantastic city go and have brilliant time, some good clubs down by the sea.
