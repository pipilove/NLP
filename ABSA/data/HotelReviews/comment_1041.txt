OK Hotel, Booking it was a problem

I had booked a superior room online, which was immediately charged to my card. A few days later I had to call them to change the dates, due to unavoidable charter flight changes.I understood that if I were to cancel, I would lose the money, however I explained that I didn't want to cancel my reservation, I simply wanted to change the dates. At first they refused, and said they'd keep 100% of the money, and I'd be forced to pay for other nights, or go somewhere else.After much arguing, I was able to change the dates, and they allowed us by exception to stay in a standard room, but at the SUPERIOR rate.During the process, they basically accused me of making my story up, citing that people have made up stories of their pets dieing, etc. in order to cancel reservations.Again, I didn't want to cancel, just change dates.Once there, the hotel was fine, our room was tiny (to be expected, but that's why I had originally booked a superior)... however I'm surprised (or perhaps not) by the arrogance and entitlement of the people I had to deal with in order to make changes to our reservation.If my card hadn't already been charged, there's no way I would have given them my business.
