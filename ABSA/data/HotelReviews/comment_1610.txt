good hotel but not perfect

The hotel is well situated, but very noisy because of e big construction site at the corner and the streets around. On the hotel website they don't say anyhing about this construction. Rooms are quite nice, well furnished (we were 2 aduts ans 3 kids and had a one bedroom suite with a roll away bed and double sofa bed in the siting room) . The bathroom is very tiny even for 2 persons and looked quite old for a 4 stars hotel. For the 5 of us it was a good price. Restaurant lola downstairs is very good but expensive in the evening. The staff is nice and helpful.
