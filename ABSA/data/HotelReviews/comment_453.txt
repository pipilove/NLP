Fantastic Hotel, Brilliant staff, let down by NOISE

On Arriving it was a relief to arrive to some normality from staying in Paris for two nights, the staff were faultless from start to finish, the room, which i paid extra to upgrade on arrival, was fantastic, nice dark wood floor, great bathroom, travertine tiles, spa bath, the bedroom was brilliant, pillow menu, kingsize bed and 180degree views of the harbour, however the view was the let down, 5am a ferry docked up right outside my window, to be honest it would have been everyone on that side's window as it was so big, cue a very loud PA speaker for 15 mins, followed by men hitting metal on metal for i have no idea what reason, all in all a great stay completley ruined, if i had any heavy inate objects i would have thrown them at said chaps with hammers or whatever it was they were so carelessly using.i would have given this hotel a 4 or 5 rating but the noise really did ruin everything, it's totally without justification for a hotel of this price and class to sell someone a room knowing that at 5am there will be noise that literally no one could sleep through, earplugs and double-tripple glazing couldn't have drowned it out. that being said, do stay here, but make sure that if you do, as you look at the hotel from the front, only stay on the left hand side looking onto the city rather than the harbour, even then i think that PA will travel.
