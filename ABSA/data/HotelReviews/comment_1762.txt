Watertown Seattle's Best

The Watertown Hotel in Seattle is my favorite place to stay. The rooms are immaculate, the location is very central, free high speed internet, etc. The a la carte program is a lot of fun and can be a great way to relax. The wine tasting in the evening is very unique and they have and interesting and unique Pacific Northwest wine list. The best part about the Watertown are the staff. I've always received the best service, the best restaurant recommendations and I always look forward to going back.
