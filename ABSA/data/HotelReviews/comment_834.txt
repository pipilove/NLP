Nice hotel shame about location

Really nice clean hotel only downside is the location, it's at the bottom of K'damm and the wrong side of town for all the main sights and the nightlife! Although the public transport is on your doorstep, excellect and safe we just found it a pain having to cross town every day and night, especially if you want to enjoy the excellent Berlin nightlife, as all that happens in the Mitte area (party animals do not stay here!). There is a really nice New York style bar/restaurant called Juleps about 200 yds from hotel, recommend there for a nice meal. Sights not to be missed are Jewish Museam, Checkpoint Charlie Museam and the Eastside gallery where you can walk 1.3km of the Wall that still stands (get off at the last stop of the U1 going east). Also the TV tower has good views and Tiergarten is lovely for a nice stroll. Shopping is also great but be warned nothing opens on a Sunday!! Berlin is a really cool city, loads to see and do and another plus is we felt really safe here, even travelling on the u-bahn at 3am!
