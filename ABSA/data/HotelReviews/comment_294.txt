Post-Review update.

I had previously written a review on this hotel(----) and suffered a rather harrowing experience from the owners as a consequence.I am only posting this now because I had thought that the DeRappers 'hospitality' towards me had been a one off but from one of the latest reviews I see this is not neccessarily so.Having arrived home and posted my review, I received a not-very-pleasant phonecall from Hans, demanding to know why I took it upon myself to write my opinions online (which, might I add are quite balanced, and not a personal attack such as I was then subjected to).He proceded to ask me irrelevant questions such as what do I do for a living (incidently, I am in Law), and generally try to pick holes in anything that I said which did not please him. NOT charming! I'm writing this now as a sort of 'warning' sign to anyone else who may receive this kind of treatment upon not writing a glowing review, so much for freedom of speech eh! We have since stayed in genuinely brilliant B+B's with hosts who go out of their way to make sure your stay is a happy one, sorry Hans, yours just wasn't in the same league.
