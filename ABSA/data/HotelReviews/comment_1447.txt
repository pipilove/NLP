Overall a very good hotel

We stayed there while attending a convention at the nearby Moscone Center. Found it to be a great central location right off Market Street next to a BART station. Did all our sightseeing from there by foot, streetcar, and BART train.The room was attractive, done in red, gold, and dark wood--adequate in size and comfortable though not quite spacious. The bed, linens, blanket, and pillows were not of the best quality, should be upgraded. The view from our 25th-floor room through a large bay window facing east was very pleasant. Housekeeping did a superb job, keeping the room and bathroom spotless. Having no safe in the room was a hugh inconvenience especially since it usually took so long for a front desk agent to assist you at the boxes downstairs.The Renaissance Club Lounge on the 31st floor had a breathtaking view, and the complimentary breakfast was excellent. Most of the staff were very pleasant and helpful.Would we stay there again? Absolutely!
