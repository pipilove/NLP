Loved Hotel; But Beware

We spent 3 nights in this hotel in July. It was terrific- nice, clean rooms, large bathrooms, convenient to the Metro, and a view of the Eiffel Tower. The staff was very friendly and willingly helped us with restaurant reservations and other recommendations. The area is nice too- good bakery for breakfast nearby (no need to have the overpriced hotel breakfast), and a street called Rue Cle a short distance away that has a traditional feel to it.Now the bad part. We made the reservation 9 months in advance for four nights. We paid in full as we were required to do and purchased cancellation insurance. After our itinerary changed we notified the hotel and cancelled one night of our stay- this occurred several months in advance of our arrival. We were assured that we would receive a credit for the cancelled night, which we did not receive before our arrival. Upon arrival and check-in we spoke at length to the hotel staff, who again assured us that we would receive a credit. Now, more than a month after our stay we still have received nothing. We are out almost $550 (it was for 2 rooms), so this is not insignificant.Bottom line- this is a nice hotel, but beware if you think your plans could change. They seem unwilling to honor their own cancellation insurance and refund policies.
