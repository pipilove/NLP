the hotel don't allow parent with two children

I just arrived today 7/25/07. The place look nice but I have been around the world and I never have seen unprofessional director like Jose Maria barren that he said that he was the director but I think that he doesn't has any education, I make a reservation with five star alliance two junior suite for my brother and my family when I get to the hotel after 14 hour of airplane trip. I went to the front desk to do the check in and the front desk Alexis Barcel told me that the hotel doesn't allow parent with two child. I thought I can believe it. I came with my wife, my daughter one years and my son 6 years. I never have this problem in any other hotel: I have been hotel Danieli in Venice, hotel Crillon and Athena in Paris, mandarin Oriental London, Bermudas, NY, Chicago, Praga and many more, and I never have problem. Then there was a person Jose Maria barran that get into the conversation without any presentation, very unprofessional, and I told him that his hotel doesn't have good service, and he told me to go out of my house, go to hell! And my only answer to him was: if he was the owner of that place, he doesn't treat a customer like that. Thank god I just came to majestic hotel and I got a reservation very nice, more beautiful, better attention and care of the customer.
