Left Bank gem

My wife and I stayed at the hotel for 4 nights in November 2006. The room was quite pleaseant and above average in size for Paris. Nice bathroom - not sumptuous but attractive, all the necessaries and a decent size with a big window overlooking a garden and other apartments - you are not looking at a brick wall. The bed was very comfortable. Two closets, a desk, small table, 2 chairs and aqequate room to wander around - a real bonus! The front window overlooks a small park and the street.The room was quiet as it is set down a small side street.We had breakfast in the hotel one morning but it was nothing special.The real plus for this hotel is the small kitchen facility - sink, fridge, hotplate (2 burner). There are loads of cafes which offer breakfast at the same price as the hotel in the area. Also, there is a lovely boulangerie just up the road and a small grocery store around the corner so it is much, much cheaper to buy your own breakfasts, store in the fridge and have what youy want instead of the standard fare. You could also manage other meals if necessary because of the facilities. The desk staff were excellent as is the overall location of the hotel. You will be spoilt for choice as far as restaurants are concerned. Great location for Notre Dame, Pantheon, Metro, RER, shopping and the Left Bank.We would definitely stay here again.Chris  Jan, Oakville, Ontario, Canada.
