Don't stay here- they charge $75 if you depart a day early on mult- night stay

I was told that they required 24 hours to change dates of stay or cancel. I checked in and had planned on staying three nights. After the first night, I found out that I would be leaving one day early and told them -- more than 24 hours in advance -- that I would be leaving one day early. I was charged a $75 early departure fee. I will never stay here again and recommend you do not either.
