Family trip to Berlin

We stayed here for three nights in two adjacent rooms.The location is excellent for access to the station (i.e. it is the next building to Freidrichrasse station). However despite the double glazing the noise of the trains is ever present. So if you can sleep through the noise the location is perfect for the public transport and only 10 minutes walk away are Brandenberg gate, Museum Island and definietely worth visiting is the Reichtstag. In fairness the double glazing does knock out 90% of the train noise, with all windows shut.The hotel staff were friendly and made an effort to show good service. The rooms were spotless, with room service each day.The bathrooms were ample with soaps and shower gels, decent shower and bath.The breakfasts have fruit and yoghurts, cold meats and cheeses, cereal and/ or a full cooked breakfast.We chose to eat evening meals at Restaurant  Cafe Pepita on Unter Den Linten (10 mins walk from the hotel). The menu caters for Italien, Spanish and German food with the menu being in German and English. The food was excellent and served promptly. The staff were very friendly.
