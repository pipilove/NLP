Nice but not 5 star. Great location  lovely features.

Can't agree with reviews about good service - once booked in I felt we were forgotten. Maybe Spanish 5 star but this hotel is probably 3 star plus for us Brits. E-mailed hotel twice before I arrived explaining we were celebrating our silver anniversary  was surprising my wife with choice of hotel  to help arrange restaurant bookings  upgrade rooms - both e-mails were ignored. Towels  bath-robes hard not fluffy like they should be. No tea/coffee making facilities disappointing. Our first visit to Barcelona was still fantastic - will return but not to the Majestic.
