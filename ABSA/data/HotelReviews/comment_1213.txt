Accepting that centrally located elderly hotels in San Francisco are going to have to operate within space constraints, this hotel had one huge problem. It has only one small elevator so that, if it is not actually already being used by room service or the maids, you may have to share a ride with well virtually anything that needs to go up or come down in a hotel.The location also means that daylight is at a premium in the hotel and the general lack of direct light was amplified by some very earthy coloured decor (presumably because of the style being sought). This is particularly pronounced on the stairs. There is no natural light and the artificial light is not overly bright, yet they have laid brown striped carpet which makes it very difficult to see the edge of the stair tread. With the elevator problem making recourse to the stairs for descent (even at four floors up) a more frequent then usual occurrence, particular care had to be taken.The room, whilst generously proportioned and quiet, also lacked daylight and was not brightly lit artificially. It was a bit depressing. The bathroom/ shower was good for such an old building. The lack of coffee/ tea making facilities was not helpful particularly since the bar served dreadful coffee (we didn't dare ask about tea).Staff were helpful, although some seemed overly commission motivated, and there was no one to help with cases. The location is very good.
