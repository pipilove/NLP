Disappointing

I stayed here two consecutive years for a conference - the organisers booked the room. The rooms are not nearly as nice as other places they have booked for me in the general area. They promised microwaveable meals (needed after a very long drive) but these were unavailable - they could only point me to the convenience store down the road.The parking was in another property, and required negotiating several flights of stairs.The place seems to be popular with overseas school groups - I was kept awake by banging fire escape doors, and several others besides me were forced to complain to the staff. If I was paying, I might find it was a good relatively budget and convenient option, but otherwise, no. I will never attempt to park a car there again, and did not the second time.
