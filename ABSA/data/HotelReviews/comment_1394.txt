Everything appeared okay

Stayed here recently. Everything went well. I really liked the place. The hotel had been pre booked so on check out I had nothing else to pay. However, when I returned home, I discovered the hotel had charged my credit card $1.63 without my knowledge the day after check out. It is only a small sum of money but I was very concerned as I had not stolen anything from the hotel or used any of the stuff in the bedroom bar!The hotel now claims however that items were removed. The only others with access to this food and drink were the cleaning staff. I suggest to anyone staying here to make sure they know what is being taken out of their credit card before they leave this hotel.I am a very honest person who has stayed in many hotels over Europe and America and I have never before experienced an insult like this.My credit card company are supportive and refunded my money but be aware. There could have been a lot more money involved. All I have is my word that I removed no items!
