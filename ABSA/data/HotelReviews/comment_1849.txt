Wow what location, upgrade to an opera house view room

My wife and I sateyd at the hotel in November, we upgraded to an Opera house view room which was excellent, much larger than a city view and the view we had was worth a million, cannot fault it.bedroom was clean and very comfortable, bathroom large and clean.But it was the views that will leave the most endearing memories.Food was excellent.Cannot recommend it enough
