Much Better Hotels exist in Same Price Range with Better Service in BCN

I have stayed at this hotel a total of 3 times and this last stay was the worst. For a 5 star hotel, they sure dont act like one. Their reception staff is rude and unaccomodating, particularly to Americans I have noticed over my 3 trips there. The Junior Suite was small for the price (349 Euros). And beware of the packages you purchase. I purchased a Majestic SUite Package and only received the free bottle of Champagne... hotel promised champagne, chocolate truffles and some type of gift on arrival day and I only got the champagne because I called reception. reception also did not answer the internal telephone so i resorted to calling an outside line and of course they pick up right away -- they obviosuly don't consider their existing guests a high enough priority! All in all, I would avoid this hotel. I plan to stay at a better hotel next time in Barcelona. I think Majestic doesnt deserve more than 4 stars, and that is being too generous!
