Central location

Central location within walking distance of checkpoint charlie and the tube system. Really clean and quiet hotel with very friendly staff who all spoke English. Rooms are smallish but very nicely furnished and very very clean. Very sleek bathroom fittings! Breakfast was an all you can eat affair and more than filled up before we went off sightseeing.It snowed whilst we were there and was really really cold outside but the hotel and rooms were always warm and relief to get back to!This trip was a present from my boyfriend as he proposed to me in Berlin so was rather glad all was ok!Great city and a hotel that was great value for money.
