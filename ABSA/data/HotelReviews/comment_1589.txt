Sheraton - very nice

We stayed in the Union Street tower (new standard king room) and found it to be very nice!! We are usually Westin or W people, but decided to check out one of the new rooms here. Love the new design and the subway tiles in the bathroom. Bed and linens were on par with the Westin Heavenly Bed. I slept like a baby and am extremely particular about bedding. Curtains made the room completely dark - perfect for sleeping in!It was quite posh, and I would consider this hotel over the Westin aand W Seattle next time we are in town. And yup, parking is expensive everywhere in SEA. that's just how it is!
