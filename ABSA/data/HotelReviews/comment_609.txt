Disappointing

Had been warned of a noiseless facelift but was unprepared to battle my way through a foyer of painters and then have to step over debris and rolled up carpets to find the room. Really not worth the money for such a top class hotel. They should have closed for such extensive work and I think it is just greedy to keep it open but treat it's guests as second class citizens. My request to speak to the Manager was ignored as was a letter whilst I was staying there.Would not return as so much choice in Berlin but can say it's situation is ideal for walking to the sights.
