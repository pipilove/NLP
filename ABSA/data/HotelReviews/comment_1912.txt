A disgrace

I stayed in this hotel when it was the Regent on several occasions, and universally enjoyed the experience. I gather that FS are planning on upgrading the property ( I stayed with my wife in June 2006) but at last years visit, the place was dreadful. The room was expensive even by Sydney standards, and the room itself was old, badly in need of updating and impersonal.The hotel was filled with conference attendees. They held meetings all over the place in common areas, the staff did nothing to stop this. This alone made the stay dreadfulThe restaurant service was shocking, understaffed, meals left on tables well after guests had goneNot up to four seasons standards. Great position, but there are so many great hotels in Sydney that I will not stay here again until it is taken to with a broom.
