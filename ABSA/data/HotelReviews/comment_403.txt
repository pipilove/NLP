Excellent Position, Spotlessly Clean

My sisters and I have just returned from spending 3 nights in the Hotel Royal. Reviews on this site had recommeded requesting a room at the front but when we did so, we were informed that all triple rooms were at the back. However, the room was very spacious, comfortable and clean, and being on the fourth floor was quiet enough that we could have our window open all night.The hotel is in a fantastic position, and it was easy for us to pop in and out during the day to deposit bags of shopping and freshen up!The best place to have breakfast is at the Nuria Restaurant which is just a few doors up the Ramblas, next to Burger King. Just 6 euros for a full English breakfast.We would definitely stay in this hotel again.
