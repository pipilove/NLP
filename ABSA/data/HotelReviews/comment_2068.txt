Perfect Altamont

The Altamont Hotel was perfect for our weekend in Sydney. It is a small boutique hotel run by a friendly man called Alan who is very helpful. In the heart of Darlinghurst, it is perfectly located close to cafes, bars and pubs along with nearby rail stations and the central business district. The Altamont is well priced, art deco funky, warm and inviting and I would highly recommend it for anyone considering a stay in Sydney especially if they like to be in the heart of a fun and lively suburb but also close to the cbd and local tourist attractions. An excellent choice.
