My nightmare at the Eurostars

In my opinion this hotel was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The hotel itself was Ok but the carpets in the walkways were filthy, the reception was draughty and unwelcoming, the staff were rude and arrogant. We ordered room service with English tea with milk and grilled slamon, the tea arrived with no milk and the salmon was raw and cold. (I was told this was normal in Spain)On the second day I realised that I had a pot of Estee Lauder foundation missing from my dressing table, I reported this and nothing was done, it took a further 2 emails and two phone calls before I had a reply to say that I should have kept all items in the safe. I was shocked as the safe was only small, would you expect to keep coats and makeup in the safe. This has never happened to me before., all they offered was a free upgrade to a better room next time we stayed but they would have to pay me to get me to stay there again. I am not the complaining type but this really shocked me.
