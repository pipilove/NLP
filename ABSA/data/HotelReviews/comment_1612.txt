Good Service, Great Beds, but Over-priced

We stayed at Hotel Andra for two nights. The staff were very helpful throughout the stay. The place is beautifully decorated and the rooms were of average size. I found the place to be quite clean. The bed was wonderful. I usually have a terrible night's sleep in a hotel, but had a great sleep two nights in a row. I did not find the hotel to be noisy, but my husband did. I did find the hotel to be a bit over priced for what we got. It is billed as being a small luxury hotel but really didn't see it as being any different other than decor. The location was great - we walked everywhere from the hotel. We only had breakfast at Lola (the adjoining restaurant) but it was excellent. I had the doughnuts!!! I'm still raving about them. Overall, I enjoyed our stay, but next time would stay somewhere less expensive.
