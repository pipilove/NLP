Awful stay at the Pulitzer

I just read some of the bad reviews for the Pulitzer and I couoldn't agree more. Last year the hotel was still getting raves and it's about time that the reviews reflect how bad the place really is. First off, we booked through Starwood and after flying in from New York via London the staff couldn't find our reservation. After much pleading we finally got our room. What a disaster. We didn't get is changed until the next day but at least we faced the courtyard instread of being in the attic. But as bad as that first room was the staff was terrible. The concierge consistantly gave bad advice if he gave any at all. My advice is to stay away from the Pulitzer.
