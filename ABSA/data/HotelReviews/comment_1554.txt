A few flaws but still preferable to HI Seattle

The Moore Hotel is touted as a once grand hotel and serious emphasis must be placed on the 'once'. Although the lobby appears relatively modern, the internal decor/style of the rooms are reminiscent of the 1940s. Rooms are very basic to say the least, but you only get what you pay for and the Moore represents fair value. The TV in our room was damaged with poor sound quality and the bed slightly uncomfortable. Rooms do not appear to have any functioning heating or built in fan/cooler/heaters which is a bit of a drawback depending on when you visit. However the rooms were clean and the front desk staff incredibly helpful and welcoming. We even got a free upgrade to a room with a ensuite. Internet access is free in the lobby and the Moore's downtown location is good. Travellers considering staying at the mediocre Hostelling International Seattle should seriously consider staying at the Moore instead. The location is better,safer,cleaner and the price virtually the same if you were considering a private room at HI.
