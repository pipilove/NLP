Very Bad Service

Booked this hotel from the internet and everything looked fine on the web site. Unfortunately apon arrivial found that this hotel is in a real need of a wake up call i found all staff rude and unwilling to help with offering assistance, i always had to ask. I also ate in the Hotels Signature restaurant and found the food over priced and lacked any taste or style at all. I would recommend for anyone who does stay there to eat outside of the hotel. My last complaint of the hotel is that i wouldnt ask the door man for a taxi its quicker to get one your self.
