Don't stay here if you don't Know Spanish!!!

I booked this hotel on a tip from family members that this hotel is very good 5star hotel in Barcelona, But as i discovered this hotel must be a 3 star hotel!!!!If you want only a location then this hotel is your best bet in Barcelona for a shopping and walking around location, it's in the middle of all the main shops and restaurants....That's All....The rest are all Negatives....The only people who speak english in this hotel are the front desk staff and whoever in the ground floor.... when you go to the room you feel you are lost because no one speaks or understands english when you call Room Service, House Keeping or any service they have !!!!I had to contact the front desk every time i wanted to order something or ask about something !!!The Suite i stayed in had good size, but the furniture is Old Old, the T.V. has digital spanish channels but if you want to watch the other languages channels you have to use the analoge channels which are either inturrepted often or not as clear sometimes.....Concierge, NON existant at this hotel!!! your best bets is to try and hope that 1 of the front desk staff is not busy.....the hotel needs a Major Renovation for the entire hotel rooms plus an English Course for all the Staff....
