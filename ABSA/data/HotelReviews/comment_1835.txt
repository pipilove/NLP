Comfortable hotel

Stayed here for 2 nights as part of a work awards night. It was a very pleasant stay, the room was spacious and decorated in heritage colours. Being a work package we were in the cheapest rooms, so didn't have a view, but no complaints as the room made up for it.Very close to Circular Quay and MCA where the event was held.My only complaint was the hotel didn't deliver the welcome letter explaining when to arrive at the event and that there would be a photographer outside to snap professional mementos of the evening, so as a result only about 10% of the guests knew about this.
