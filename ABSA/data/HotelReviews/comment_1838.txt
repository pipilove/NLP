Great hotel, shame about the staff!

We stayed at the Sydney Harbour Marriott for a few days in March. Booked using Marriott reward points for 4 nights. Closer to the trip, we added an extra night but explained that we wouldn't be arriving until early the next morning (landed at about 6 am and wanted to get straight into our room after the long trip from the UK).Got to the hotel and the fact that we had booked for one night and were only just arriving caused them no end of confusion. We had phone messages every day because they couldn't find the reservation with the points on. On one occasion, they also couldn't manage to switch off the message light so we had this flashing all night (or until we unplugged the phone).Other than fairly useless staff, you could have been in any big chain hotel anywhere in the world. It was clean, comfortable and characterless, but we only wanted a city base so weren't bothered about that.Wouldn't bother paying the upgrade charge for the harbour view. I imagined a glorious view of the whole sweep of Sydney harbour with the opera house. What we got was a view of the opera house in between other tower blocks - really not worth bothering with.Didn't have brekkie included in the deal and there are loads of places you can get a good breakfast for half the price of the Marriott. Don't bother paying for brekkie unless you really want to pig out at the buffet. I would class this as a characterless hotel, great location and okay as a central base for exploring Sydney.
