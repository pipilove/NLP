A Perfect Spot

I chose the Mediterranean Inn as a start to our Pacific Northwest trip. We needed a hotel in Seattle in a good location with a decent rate. That's what we got with the Mediterranean Inn. Its not the downtown location that most people look for but its convenient. The monorail to downtown is three blocks away. The Key Arena and the Space Needle are also three blocks located in the Seattle Center complex. It is a safe area to walk. One block over is a Safeway grocery store. What tops it is the Starbucks in the lobby. Check the web site for a better rate. Be aware there is a fee for parking. There is a lot next door that has overnight parking. I didn't know this until check out. Look into it before the hotel charges you. We were very satisfied with the choice. After the review of other Trip Advisor members, they were too.
