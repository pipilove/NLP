Wouldn't return, beds are very hard!

The swissotel has to be the best location for those of us who love to shop and for that the hotel scores great marks, however when staying in a hotel I would expect to be pampered or at the very least not longing to return to my own bed. This is exactly what I was doing at 2am when I couldn't sleep because the beds are so hard I would have been more comfortable on the carpet. The bathrooms look lovely but at a second glance the floors look like they need a good scrub. The staff were lovely but I wouldn't consider returning.
