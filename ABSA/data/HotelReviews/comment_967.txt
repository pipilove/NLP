The Wonderful Concierge Service....

I just needed a one night stay before returning home. I wish I had stayed at this hotel my entire stay in Paris. On the down side the bed was not especially comfortable and it was typically tiny (by US standards) but big enough to move around in. Also, sound travels through the floors and walls but this wasn't a big problem because the clients of Grand Hommes seem a particularly quite bunch. The hotel made up for these minor issues because the staff was so polite, professional and helpful. This was really welcome because during my 10 day business stay in Europe I had encountered some hotel staff that ranged from I really hate my job to I really hate you. The appointments in the bathroom were perfect and the entire place is impeccably decorated and clean, clean, clean! I had to check out before breakfast was served but the desk staff made me a nice cup of coffee gratis. I had the superior room and although it didn't face the Pantheon, it was on a quiet courtyard with double doors that opened onto a private little terrace with a cafe table and two chairs. Next time I'm in Paris, I would like to stay at Grand Hommes for pleasure - you can't get much more romantic - with the Pantheon across the street, a long view of the Effel Tower around the corner, and the Seine and Luxembourg Gardens just a stroll away. I wouldn't consider this a family/kid/teen kind of place, nor was it for the young and hip - but for the rest of us with a couple hunderd Euros to spend for a night's lodging I definately recommend it.
