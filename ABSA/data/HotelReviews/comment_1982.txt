Get an inside room if you want to sleep

We recently stayed at the Radisson on Saturday and Sunday night. The room faced onto Pitt Street - it was a Premier room, the next step up from Atrium. When we arrived it seemed quiet and we didn't hear street noise. However, that night a nearby club was blasting music outside. It was so loud and so late at night that I believe in most US cities you'd have to get a permit. I finally called reception at 12:45am and was told it would stop at 1am. When it was still blaring at 1:15am, I called again to request to be moved to another room. The said they didn't have any other rooms, and that they had called the club and were told it was a special function that would go until 2am. They offered me no alternatives. At this point I wish I had called the police, because it's very doubtful to me that this volume of noise outside would be legal. However, I just suffered through until it finally stopped. This is probably a lesson for any urban hotel - get an inside room. I wish we had saved some money and gotten an Atrium room so that we could sleep. Otherwise the room was gorgeous, the bed comfortable, and the bathroom spectacular. Oh well.
