Wow, what a place

This hotel is right on Darling Harbour, we had a fantastic view of the harbour. The rooms are large and clean and a good price. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel is within easy walking distance of various restaurants, cafes, bars and shops. Would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Sydney
