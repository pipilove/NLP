Poor service at the front desk

Overall, the rooms are alright at the Courtyard however our stay was overshadowed by the poor service. My husband and I arrived at the hotel early in the morning (at approx 10am) after travelling from Venice...so we were quite exhausted with the plane and then subway/train travel from the airport. We requested to check-in early however were told that we had to wait for the next available room. We both asked the lady at the front desk (I should have got her name so that i could've complained to hotel management) to call us from the lobby if our room was ready since we had just taken an early flight from Venice (6am) and needed to freshen up so we could walk around the city. After 1 1/2 hours of waiting, we went to the front desk and asked again but there were no rooms available still...even though we found out that the first lady at the front desk didn't really put a rush on the request! Then about 3 hours later after we saw many people check-in, we asked the front desk again and apparently they had our key just sitting there on the table!!!!! We thought it was very poor service that no one bothered to tell us the room was ready even though there were full aware that we set up 'camp' and were lying on their couches in the lobby!! Then when we got our 2 suitcases out of storage, no one bothered to ask if we needed any help. Everyday we saw a man standing outside the hotel acting like a security guard but not even bothering to assist with luggage or even open the door!! Overall, this was very poor service...and throughout my 7 weeks of consecutive travelling...i found this hotel to be the worst service in europe. I even stayed in 2-star hotels that had better customer service than this hotel. So be aware when booking, and don't be fooled by any low prices. Plus, this hotel is out of the way of the main tourist areas....so not really worth it if you want to stay in the central downtown district.
