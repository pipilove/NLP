disappointed,concerned

We were surprised and disappointed at the condition of our room.We would have asked to be placed in another room if our schedule would have permitted. There were several stains on the carpet and furniture.The bathtub had moldy/dirty caulking,the mattress cover was not fitted and rolled up all night to the point of being very uncomfortable.Our morning paper never arrived.Now for our concerned part.We had booked reservations at Sheraton in Hawaii prior to this experience.Now we are having second thoughts of making this trip to just discover a repeat performance of disappointment.Thankyou for the opportunity to review and we hope this message will help you do what is necessary to avoid anymore of the same.Room 513,9/29/07
