disappointed with Hotel D'Albe

Shabby,small room , very badly in need of re-decoration, corridors also shabby and very tight. Wafer thin walls between bedrooms - very noisy. Reception area very limited. Have stayed in Paris hotels at half the price for twice the value. Great vibrant location v. near Notre Dame. Will never return!!
