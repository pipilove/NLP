Just OK

We stayed here for 4 nights May 24-27We booked on the basis of the reviews here and were a little disappointed.Positives.It's in a good location by Fisherman's Wharf/Pier 39.It's a good base for exploring and near the cable car stops.Complimentatry coffee/tea in the morning and wine/beer in the evening.Free Wireless internet access.Staff courteous and helpful.Price.NegativesSmall room - Not enough storage room if you had suitcases.Noisy a/c - I mentioned this and it was made quieter but still unusable for more than a few minutes at a time because of the noise.Housekeeping - We returned one evening and the bed appeared to have been made but when the sheets were pulled back the mattress was exposed. Also the sheets had holes.Room generally had a 'tired' feel.This is a good base if that's all you are using it for but don't expect too much.PS we did the Segway tour and it was excellent - highly recommended!
