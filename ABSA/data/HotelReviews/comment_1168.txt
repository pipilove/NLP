Super location

We spent two nights at the Hotel de Varenne. Our room overlooked the small courtyard and was very clean. The double bed was extremely comfortable. The shower was good and powerful with soaps and shampoo provided together with warm towels from the heated towel rail.A flat screen TV with satellite channels completed the facilities.Breakfast was the usual continental with freshly baked baguette, pastries and preserves, fruit juice and tea or coffeee. The down side is the dining room is quite small and can become crowded.The only reason we did not rate as 'excellent' is because we waited 15 minutes sitting at an uncleared table before clearing it ourselves and getting the manager's attention for some service. The previous day we had excellent service so maybe we were just unlucky on this occasion.This hotel is ideally situated for walking to the usual Paris sights, Eiffel Tower, Place de la Concorde, even 'les grands magasins'.As this was our first visit to Paris we took advantage of L'Open Tour, an open top bus tour. We opted for the two day ticket, giving four different tours, to orientate ourselves. Unfortunately, the weather was so cold that we spent the tours inside rather than on the open upper deck. This ticket was good value at 29 Euro as against 26 Euro for a one day pass.We also tried the 'Batobus' a river boat cruise, again with the two day option. This was a very relaxed way to cruise the Seine, in a totally enclosed glass cruise boat.We travelled via Eurostar which was quick and comfortable. Buying a 'carnet' of ten tickets for the Metro was a bit excessive as we only used four because walking and the bus tours were so convenient.We will certainly visit Paris again, and will probably use the same hotel, as the location is ideal.
