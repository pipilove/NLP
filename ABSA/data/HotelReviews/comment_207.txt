An extremley enjoyable stay at Hotel Nadia!

Hotel Nadia is a lovely hotel in an excellent location. The staff were all very friendly and helpful, the room very small but was clean and had everything we needed. Would highly recommend Hotel Nadia and would definately stay again if visiting Amsterdam in the future.
