Good, but a caution...

I like the modern decor, and the location is excellent. The roof-top swimming pool is a priceless option on a hot summer day. Friendly staff. Unimpressive breakfast and zero atmosphere in the adjoining lobby area, but so what. The construction quality is rather shoddy, and the rooms can show obvious signs of damage (big patch in bathtub, wall lamp partly pulled out) after just one year of operation.The first time I stayed there just after the hotel opened, we were on an upper floor and had no problems with noise, though one could hear muffled street sounds in the background. The second (and probably last) time I stayed there, I was on the second (lowest) floor, and the metro was hugely bothersome and impossible to ignore. I could feel the vibrations in the walls!! I can confirm, the Barcelona metro stops just after midnight and starts at 5:30 am.Stay at this hotel. But get a room above the fourth floor!!
