Royal Hotel - Las Ramblas

This hotel has a great location if you want to do the whole tourist thing around the Ramblas. It's located right on the Ramblas near the Placa de Catalunya and within easy walking distance of the Born area and such like.The cost is about what you'd expect to pay for the location.I stayed in one of the small double rooms. It was fine as you don't really go to Barcelona to stay in a hotel room.The rooms have most of the standard facilities and are clean and comfortable.I've stayed in this hotel on a number of occasions on business trips as well and the staff are friendly and helpful.
