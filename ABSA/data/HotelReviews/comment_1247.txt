Diamond in the Ruff

The chancelor is ideally located, seconds away from Union Square, and you can catch the trolley to take you to the trains/MUNI or just walk it, its just blocks away. The rooms are beautiful and cozy. The staff is amazingly helpful and accomadating. The weather in SF makes it unnecessary for AC, an open window was just enough for us... and we're from TX where AC is absolutely necessary!
