Nadia Hotel....Love or Leave it?

I've traveled throughout Europe quite a bit and stayed at several different hotels. I know that most older hotels in Europe are not as big as what we're accustomed to in the States, and prepare myself for this ahead of time. The Bad Stuff-The photos used on Nadia's website are very misleading. A panaromic view is shown which gives the viewer an illusion that the rooms are bigger. We had a triple room with a balcony. The room was ridiculously small! Two people would've fit comfortably in this room. The bathroom/shower was a joke! The shower leaked throughout the bathroom which made the situation even worse. If you're not young  in decent health, I would leave this hotel alone because of the most treacherous stairs! The Good Points-The hotel staff is most delightful! They were all very eager to help  gave us great advice. Although they were pleasant it's still not enough for me to go back. The balcony was fabulous. As far as the location, it was great. Not far from Dam Square  the Red Light District. The price was fair considering what we lived with for 4 days. If you don't mind being in small spaces, climbing like 80 stairs  sleeping on a rock hard bed with matching pillow, then this is the place for you.
