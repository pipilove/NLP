adequate but some irritations.

It was cheap, clean and quite comfortable and that should have been adequate, except for a few issues.There were 6 of us in 3 rooms, each one of us with a card key.Over 2 days, we had to traipse back to Reception on average twice each to have the card rekeyed as it would no longer open our doors. It became frustrating.4 of us had arrived at 10am, too early for 2pm checkin, but were pleased to store our bags and explore. At 12:30, the last couple arrived at the hotel and were able to check in immediately. Good for them.Us 4 traipsed back to the hotel at about 1:30, still early, yet one couple were accommodated immediately. Husband and I were asked to wait 10 mins. No problem. We sat and waited 50 mins until it became evident they had completely forgotten about us. It happens everywhere, but it's annoying when the 6 of us were itching to get out and about again.The service was not offensive, but not friendly either.It's a very busy hotel on the edge of the CBD, in a not particularly attractive area. However, taxis seem to drop off guests at about 5 min intervals so it's easy to catch one. Museum Train Station is just around the corner, the monorail is a short walk away. We had an easy walk down the hill to Chinatown and Darling Harbour... coming home uphill needs more exertion.There is no lounge area for a quiet drink. You must go out for lunch and dinner, or order in from a number of local eateries. Breakfast is particularly ordinary, but totally adequate (muesli, yoghurt, corn flakes, toast, baked beans, scrambled eggs, bacon and sausages). The hotel seems to have a large patronage of Asians, so one would have thought a noodle dish at least would have been offered. As a previous reviewer said, there is a great little spot for breakfast around the corner called Two Good Eggs.
