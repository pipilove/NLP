Be aware, my money were stolen in Pulitzer

I stayed in Pulitzer 3rd-6th June 2008. I checked in the hotel 2.00pm and I was desparetely hungry. I just quickly throw my luggage in the room, took some money from the wallet and went out for a lunch. In a hurry I just left my wallet in cupboard, not in safety box (my mistake!). There was 250€ when I left the wallet in my room, but when I returned 1 hour later there was only 150€ So 100€ was missing. I informed lady in the front desk about the incident and she promised to investigate it.Next day I talked with the Front Desk Manager and she gave me the printouts, which showed who had visited my room in previous day. There was a fact that 2 cleaning ladies had visited my room when I had been having a lunch, but they denied taking the money.So there was a proof that 2 cleaning ladies had visited my room, 100€ was gone. My word against them. The answer from the hotel was that as I had not put my money in the safety box, they are not responsible of them. I never got my money back and I didn`t even get the apology from hotel.If you want go this hotel, don`t leave your money out of your sight!
