problems at check in spoilt a lovely hotel

we had booked a superior room but upon arrival we were told they had no rooms available ! we had already paid via expedia. They put us in a taxi to the warwick hotel which was on a noisy street and was no where near the quality of the plaza vendome. I was told that we would be upgraded to a junior suite but upon our (inconvenient) return we were only given an executive room which was small and I suppose very similar to the room we booked. The hotel was lovely but I didnt get a refund for the cheaper friday night stay and it somewhat spoilt the hotel for me. The location and style are excellent. shame about the booking.
