Huge rooms at the Watertown

I stayed at the Watertown Hotel, located near the university, because I had a special deal from TravelZoo.com for $10 off the regular price. It was a delightful experience and better, for my traveling taste, than the W Hotel downtown (for which I also had a TravelZoo discount). Finding it is easy, parking onsite is easy, and the surrounding neighborhood is interesting and funky. The Watertown has a clever ala cart menu that visitors can use to select carts (literally) for their room based on what theme sounds interesting to them--spa cart comes with bath goodies, art cart comes with crayons and watercolors, baby cart comes with things you'd want if traveling with an infant. You can request a cart in advance or when you check in. My room, located in a corner, was the size of my living and dining rooms at home--I couldn't believe how huge it was. I highly recommend staying at the Watertown and eating at the vegetarian restaurant Carmelita located about 15 minutes' drive away, through a residential area.
