hairs in the bathroom!

We stayed here for nights in early Feb after getting a special deal of $99 per night for staying 5 nights.The hotel room was a decent size with a well-maintained kitchenette, however the quality of cleaning left much to be desired. There were hairs all over the bathroom floor when we arrived. After three days of waiting, we had to ask for them to be cleaned.Don't expect the check-in staff to be too helpful either, they put us in a twin, considering we also had a cot to fit in, it was a tight squeeze.Overall good price, poor service.
