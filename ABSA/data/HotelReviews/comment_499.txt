Torre Catalunya

A nice place to stay Plus points.Nice bedroom great bathroom and very clean, helpful receptionist who checked us in early and explained the train system etc. Great view of the city from the restaurant. Good breakfast. Tube stations close.Minus points.Sants station building works, listening to jack hammers one morning at 2am nice. Would not recomend stopping here until the works is complete which looks like will take a long time. Not many nice places to eat in the vicinity.If you want good food go to the Attic near the top end of the Ramblers. If you're looking for a great meal out in a modern, chic setting, this is the place for you.
