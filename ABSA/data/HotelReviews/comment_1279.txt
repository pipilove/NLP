Great value - Great location

Trip Advisor led us to this hotel and we were very pleased with the 'recommendation'. This is a no frills place to stay but the staff are very friendly and the location is great.Fisherman's Wharf is within easy walking distance as are the bus and tram routes that can take you all over SF. The hotel is situated in a bohemian part of town with lots of relaxed restaurants and coffee shops just round the corner. The area felt very safe. Staff were very helpful and helped to map out all the places to go - and not go! Their advice was valuable. The rooms were clean and adequate - we didnt spend much time in them...remember there are no 'communal' type hotel facilities.The Castle Inn is a great option for travellers who dont mind being slightly out of town but need to be somewhere safe within shooting distance of the attractions. We would definitely recommend it.
