I Would Stay At The Kirketon Next Time....

I stayed here during the end of September/start of October 2005. I have never been backpacking before and this is probably as close as I will ever come to it (I hope). The hotel it self is fine. If you're after basic accomodation, then this place is for you. Rooms are clean, minimal and functional - I had a ground floor room and no problem with noise. The location is great. However, if you like Waitrose (nice supermarket in England for those of you outside the UK) as opposed to Kwik-Save (cheap place-think K Mart), then this place probably won't be to your liking...it lacks a certain kind of finesse that one would like to expect from an establishment that bills it self as a hotel rather than being one of those places that has an 's' before the 't' (hostel). The front desk area looked more like someone's home office, I wasn't sure if there was breakfast available - though I do recall seeing a loaf of bread near the front desk - toast anyone? My room was not very well lit, perfect for those moments when you feel like getting dressed in the dark. The concrete floor may have been daring interior design when the ho[s]tel opened, but now reminded me of a local authority car park I was sick outside aged six. None of these things ruined my stay because I didn't go to a fun city like Sydney to spend time inside my hotel room, however, I would probably stay at the Kirketon next time.
