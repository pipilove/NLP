Spoiled by The Adina

Stayed for 3 nights in Feb. Second time to Berlin and couldn't decide which hotel so we split the trip. Loved the location! The hotel was nice enough. Asked in advance for a room with a view--not. Low floor and a construction view. Paid for a business class room and was given what I believe was a regular room and was told that to have a room with more windows would be 20 more a night. The amenities for my type of room were also non existent. Their website does not list 2 types of business rooms. Also asked to use a computer to check our flight and was told it would be 8 e.The Adina really spoiled us--very friendly staff. The Park Inn let us check in early, but acted like they were doing us a Huge favor. We would have been happy to store our luggage if we could have got the room we paid for. Also very sneaky during check in asked if we wanted breakfast which they would have added to our rate--yet didn't say that it would be extra till we asked about it.The Park Inn is lucky it is in such a great convienent area otherwise I think it would be lower on tripadvisor .
