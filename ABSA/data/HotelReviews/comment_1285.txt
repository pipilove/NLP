A Great Place to Stay

My girlfriend and I recently stayed at the Orchard Hotel during our trip to San Francisco (4/24-4/26). It was outstanding. Great location. Super views (we were on the 10th floor). Very clean and comfortable room. The service was extremely friendly. The hotel itself was everything we could've hoped for and a little bit more. We stayed at two other places during our trip (one in the city / one outside) and found that this hotel provided our most enojoyable/comfortable stay. The only drawback was that we were under the impression that our breakfast was included with the room and were then surprised to find out that wasn't the case. Unfortunately, nobody told us this up front and we found out last minute (as we were about to order). Very minor note overall. . .we walked down the street and had a great breakfast at Lori's. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who wants to enjoy San Francisco. It is a boutique hotel with the ammenities of a major chain. We loved it.
