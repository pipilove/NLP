Nice hotel, but not fabulous

After reading the reviews of this hotel, I was expecting something extraordinary. My husband and I stayed at the Inn for two nights over labor day week. The rooms were smaller and basically appointed. I can not say I was overly impressed with the room though it was clean and the hotel staff was nice. The biggest complaint would have to be the shuttle service. While it is great to offer the service, they need to have more than one driver operating as there are many travelers that are depending on the one van to drive them to and from various downtown locations. I assume the rates we are charged help to cover the cost of this shuttle service and they should investigate adding a second van. There are several really nice restaurants close by including Joey's and Chandlers Crab House. Overall a satisfying stay.
