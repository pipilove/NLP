Modern hotel...pretty comfortable.

This is a very modern and comfortable hotel with great access to public transport and airport transport. The staff is very friendly, spoke english very well, and seemed pretty helpful. My room was a King size bed, with a private bathroom, closet, safe, and fantastic air conditioning. The lighting situation was a little tricky in that you needed to use a room key to turn the lights on by sticking it in a slot by the inside of the door. That information would have been helpful had the front desk told me that right away, but after a quick trip down, they told me what to do. No harm...no foul. There is a very nice business center on the 9th floor where you can do your flight check ins, but there was no printer that I saw. The only drawback to staying at this hotel is while the location is right by the Metro, it's sort of far from lots of the attractions. Taking the metro is a must during the nighttime hours as this is not the safest city by any means. I do not recommend walking from Las Ramblas at night, unless you enjoy being propositioned multiple times by underage prostitutes or getting your passport stolen and robbed of your wallet. Both of which I saw happening firsthand.This has nothing to do with the hotel, it's the city in general. Not so safe. Once inside the hotel, all seemed safe.
