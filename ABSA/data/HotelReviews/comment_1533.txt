Perfect place to sleep

I went to the Moore with a few co-workers as a getaway to see Seattle's sights. The location was perfect, being close to Pike Market, shopping and the space needle. The hotel itself is old, but it accomodated very well for 4 professional twenty-something girls. The room was very clean, the beds comfortable, had a huge walk-in closet (doubles for a small bedroom, haha) and extremely affordable. I was pleased with the staff, and that they were able to hold our luggage in a securely locked room after we checked out. All in all, it was a great stay!
