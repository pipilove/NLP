Unprofessional

It's a real shame that the Argonaut is probably the nicest hotel I've ever stayed at, but upon checkout we were charged an additional $21.00 for beer. Apparently the cleaning staff noticed empty beer cans in the room and assumed that we had taken them out of the minibar, which we didn't open even once during our stay. We bought beer at a local market and brought it back to our room. We explained this to the staff when we checked out, and they told us that they would remove this bogus charge, but when I got my credit card bill, the charge was still there. Most hotels have a better way of keeping up with what's taken out of minibars. My suggestion is that if you stay at the Argonaut and don't plan to use the minibar, return your key to it immediately. Don't get caught in their trap.I paid enough just to stay at this hotel, and to be charged even one penny extra is an insult. But to be lied to by the hotel staff goes beyond thunderdome.And a word to the cleaning staff: I left you a generous tip because I thought you did such a great job cleaning the room each day. However, because of you, I will never leave a tip again in a hotel room, and believe me, I will never stay at the Argonaut again.
