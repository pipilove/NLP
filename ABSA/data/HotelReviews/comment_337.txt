There must be better value than this in Barcelona!

Considering how expensive this hotel is, I don't think it really offers the best quality available in Barcelona.The hotel's location is great and (if the weather is good), the rooftop terrace is a great addition (although the pool is probably better for kids to splash in rather than trying to actually swim in).The beds are big (generally queen size) but the rooms are a tad on the small side - especially at the lower end of the hotel's scale.I was surprised to be asked to pay for a stamp when I asked the reception desk to post a letter on my behalf - hotels of this standard rarely ask for the price of a stamp.The restaurant (Drolma) is fantastically expensive (min. €50 for a starter or main!), but I subsequently learnt it has a Michelin star and the food is incredible - well worth the experience. My tip - go for the set menu, which is good value for money. Drinks, for a restaurant of this quality were surprisingly reasonable (around €8 a glass).
