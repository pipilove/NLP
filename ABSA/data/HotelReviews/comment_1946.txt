everthing around it

We have stayed this hotel just one night for experience since I have read nice review for it here, trip adviser. It was absolute right. You can go any shop or store in Sydney very easily. View from room is superb and excellent because all rooms are on high floor in this building. We enjoyed night view especially with Sydney harbor. Bath room and Bed is nice. People in hotel is friendly and well organized. It was best deal for us to stay here with promotion rate. We would like to stay here again.
