Need to be a heavy sleeper

I picked this hotel for the first two nights of our trip to Europe with our toddler. I knew it was a little out of the way and wanted to make sure we were in a quiet location to get our sleep. I was pleasently suprised when we got there. It was very elegant and clean and in a beautiful location. However, we were woken each night by noise from above. The building is very old (hence the charm), but the walls are paper thin. The first night, I woke up every 30 minutes due to noise. The second night, we all woke at 12:30. The man in the room above us was having a meeting. We called the front desk several times since none of us could sleep. Finally, my husband took my (now crying) daugher to the lobby and the front desk clerk handed him the keys to the suite on the top floor. We moved, but by this point the whole night and the next day were shot. If you can stay on the TOP floor, I highly recommend this hotel. Otherwise, you better be a good sleeper.I regret to say that I had read other complaints about noise in this hotel before making my reservation.
