Not a typical Four Seasons

We often stay at the Four Seasons (when the price is right) ... but this location really didn't live up to the standards of the hotel's reputation. The room smelled somewhat damp  moldy. The room was very small and overall unimpressive. This is the only Four Seasons (so far) that has not lived up to the name ... it feels like a 're-labeled hotel' ... The only good things about the hotel were location and room views. The view came at a price though. This leaves the only benefit to its location.So ... if you can find a location close to the attractions you are interested in ... save the money ... Be sure to try to see a show at the Opera House ... it is a good experience ... and one of the few things to do in Sydney ... besides visiting the Rocks area ... and of course seeing Aboriginal Buskers and the Bridge Climb ... As an insider tip ... walk all the way across the bridge and then underneath for great photo ops of the city ... we were the only people (tourists) over there ... it was a great peaceful escape ...
