Great Hotel!! What an enjoyable stay.

This hip, stylish hotel was a bargain at $155 per night. Excellent service at the front desk. The room was large and the beds were very comfortable. Everything seemed new. They showed an attention to detail that is very unusual. A water filter under the sink. Alcohol swabs at each telephone. Real scrambled eggs and great bacon at the breakfast buffet that was included in the price. You get the idea. Very nice neighborhood with easy access to I-5.
