Savor the Savoy

Christmas in Berlin was a wonderful experience here. Little gifts everyday of our stay made it easier to be away from home during the holiday. A huge decorated Cristmas tree and poinsettias in the lobby was enhanced by the deep red walls and wallpaper and crystal chandeliers. Elegant 1920's furnishings made the lobby a comfortable place to relax after museum hopping with a drink and a book while watching the world bustle by outside the window. The German staff was attentive to our requests without exception. Complimentary bottles of water and chocolates daily was good and the mini poinsettia and tin of chocolates made us smile. We enjoyed the ease of proximity to museums and good restaurants. A cigar bar off the lobby worried us until we discovered it did not offend our non-smoking sensibilities. The bathroom here was spacious, but a disabled person (me) would have trouble with the very deep tall tub. Another comfortable chair in the room, there's one, would be a plus We only ate one breakfast here because we slept in, but its a bit expensive. A croissant and coffee around the corner was convenient and good at half the price. There are abundant taxis here but the U-bahn is cheaper and gets you most everywhere.
