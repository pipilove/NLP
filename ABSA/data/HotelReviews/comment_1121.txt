Beware!

Buyer beware! We had contacted the hotel directly via email - exchanged several very nice emails. Very friendly. When we went to check in, they did not have our reservations. When they finally checked their email records, they found it, and admitted that we did have reservations. They just could not understand why they didn't have the reservation, and they were full. They called around and found us another hotel. Much further away, not as nice, and a big disappointment. No offer of a free night some other time, or to pay for our room at the other hotel. When the receptionist was looking for our reservations, it became clear that they had a very archaic system for tracking reservations. If you're coming from far away for a once-in-a-lifetime stay in Paris, you might want to pass on this hotel.
