A good choice for Amsterdam

In a city of tiny hotel rooms at large prices, this hotel is a good bet. The rooms are not huge but they are Ok sized and comfortable and the have good sized bathrooms and the rooms have everything you need. This is part of the Raffles group and it is sad that their Asian hotels offer so much more for the same price.... But Swisshotel is a good choice in Amsterdam. The concierge is pleasant but not particularly knowledgeable.
