Disappointed

We are at last out after a 4-day unpleasant stay. The hotel is far below the level we expected for the amount of money we paid. The room was very modestely furnished and so was the old-fashioned bathroom. Internet connection was out of order and satelitte channels were limited. The hotel has no lobby and the breakfast was less than average with a very limited variety. The street is very noisy. we could hardly sleep day or night. My husband still suffers severe backache because of the unhealthy mattress. The only bright side was the kind and smiling staff. I wish them all the best, probably in a higher standard hotel where they will definely fit better. I do not recommend this hotel in spite of its central location. Trams and taxis are available.
