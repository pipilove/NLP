Good hotel, good location

We spent three nights in the Holiday Inn Darling Harbour and considered it a good hotel.Fair for the price. Helpful staff, clean rooms, good bar.Walking distance to Darling Harbour - through a nice park too. From here you can get a ferry to Circular Quay which is a nicer way to get around Sydney.The monorail stops right by the hotel so it is easy to get to from the centre (by the Tower and around that area).We'd stay again.
