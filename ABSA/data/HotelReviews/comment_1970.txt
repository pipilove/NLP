Nice facilities, lost points on service

Overall we enjoyed out stay; the hotel was of good quality, the rooms were nice and quite spacious, and the facilities were well-maintained. However 2 services error left a bad impression.Firstly, we bought a package with late checkout of 4pm. On the day of checkout, we came back to our room before the late checkout time, and had been locked out. We had to explain our case at reception and there was no apology. As we prepared our things to leave, we could hear the hotel cleaning staff standing right outside our room door, talking loudly and waiting to get in and clean the room. The second we walked out of the room, they all walked straight in - the door didn't even close behind us!Secondly, we were charged on the bill for a meal we never ordered/ate. I disputed it, and after 5 minutes, the woman at reception agreed to take it off the bill. A week later I found that this sum had been charged separately to my credit card. When I rang up to query it, I was eventually told it would be refunded, but no apology. I would expect better from such a hotel.
