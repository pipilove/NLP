What a disappointment

Tho only a 2 star had high expectations of this place based on previous TripAdvisor reviews. We stayed for 2 nights. Room was dreary and rather like hospital with drab walls. We were on the 1st floor directly above reception and smoke seemed to find its way into the room. I found the staff v unhelpful. For example, I asked someone on reception if it was possible to buy a 1-day travelcard for the metro. They didn't know. Hmmmm. Breakfast v poor for the money. Basic continental and not good quality. The hotel is not that cheap. Those searching for somewhere slightly quirky and full of character should look elsewhere. Avoid!
