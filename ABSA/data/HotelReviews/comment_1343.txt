Great location, but bring your earplugs....

We stayed at the Argonaut for a weekend in August 2007. We selected the Argonaut for its location right on the water in Fisherman's Wharf.The hotel is in a great location -- it is on the edge of the Fisherman's Wharf area and it is close to cable car, streetcar and bus stops. Our room was large and very clean. The nautical decorations are tasteful.The biggest problem that we had with this hotel was the thin walls. We heard our neighbor's television and laughter late into the night. Another issue that we had was with the bellhops. On Friday afternoon when we arrived, we wanted to take a cab. There were three parties waiting for a cab in front of the hotel, and the bellhop was having difficulty in finding cabs for us. Instead of calling a cab company to get some cabs or making some suggestions for public transportation, he told us to walk a few blocks south and we should have better luck finding a cab. It took us a sweaty half-hour to find a cab -- it was not a great way to start our trip! We relied solely on public transportation after that experience, however, and were fine.Our room had a Golden Gate view. I would not recommend paying extra for the view. The weather was foggy in the morning, and the window is not conveniently located for enjoying the view while relaxing in the room. I don't think that you would miss anything by not having the view.In short, the location and appearance of the hotel were excellent, but the thin walls and the lack of assistance with transportation will keep us from staying here in the future.
