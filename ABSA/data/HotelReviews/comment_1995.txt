Would Definately

Stay Again! I loved the Sheraton on the Park. The newly renovated rooms are beautiful, very clean and spacious. The hotel staff are very helpful and friendly. The buffet breakfast is amazing - which was included in our package. Valet parking was also included in the package - which was very useful. I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone - it's a bit pricy but it is worth every penny!!!
