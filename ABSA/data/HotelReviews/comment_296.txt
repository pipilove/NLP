Loved the Fita!

Stayed at Hotel Fita 5 nights and had an excellent stay. Our room was spacious and immaculate. It had the feel of a bed and breakfast, warm and friendly. The owners were helpful and available with useful information about their fine city. It is a great location for the art museums and the tram is literally right down the street!
