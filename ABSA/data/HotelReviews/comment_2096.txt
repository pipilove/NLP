Dissapointing

We arrived to find their carpark full and no valet service available and was told to park the car in a carpark under another hotel. This inconvenience was soon forgotten when we got to our Deluxe room we booked through [----]. The room was clean spacious and very large with a beautiful bathroom with a deep hot tub, we even had our own little balcony. As per other reviews, you are surrounded by buildingsbut at least we had glimpses of the approaches to the Harbour Bridge.The hot Buffet breakfast was excellent and the staff were very friendly. The pool was OK and the gym reasonably well appointed. I suppose the only letdown was when I had to pickup the car. Being from out of town and booked in for a knee op I had to walk for about 2kms in old railway tunnels which form the Wynyard Carpark to pick up my car then it took me half a our more to finally get back to my wife to pick her up in the Amora foyer. Not happy. I saw most people arrive at the hotel in cabs so how can their carpark be full??Sadly we won't be going back and left quite stressed. Sad because its actually one of the nicest hotels we have stayed in in Sydney with exception of the Mecure.
