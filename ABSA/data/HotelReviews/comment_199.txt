Good job we weren't health and safety inspectors!

We had been looking forward to our three days in Amsterdam for months, unfortunately the hotel was a let down to our holiday. First off, the room was not ready when we arrived. After returning later in the day to settle in, we were shocked to find....1) The amount of steep stairs to access the hotel2) The overall lack of cleanliness- the room was literally caked in dust, including in the cracks in the wall. You were not only looking at dust through the window, it flew around the room visibly in the sunlight! The safe was covered in dust and so was the fan, and the carpet did not look like it had been vacuumed since it has been opened. 3) The size of the room- you could not fully open the door as it hit the desk, and you couldn't even get your case through! The walkway between both beds was literally a matter of inches.4) The beds: One's mattress was larger than the base so that it pushed you out of bed and forced you onto the floor due to such worn springs. The other was literally hanging out of the window and the blanket got lost down the gap! They seemed itchy and infested- the place felt alive with bugs and no matter how long you spent in the shower, you didn't feel clean5) The breakfast consisted of cold bread, crackers, and cake. Anyone with a wheat intolerance would go hungry! No hot food was offered at all6) The bathroom was like a portacabin but smaller, with a shower which flooded and a toilet which broke during our stay7) The TV remote didn't work properly and was constantly stuck on one settingWe were always offered free drinks from the bar, almost as if the staff felt embarrassed by the hotel. We also had our picture taken with reception staff with the promise that it would be emailed to us when we returned to England. However, since being back we have received nothing and feel this is the last insult from this hotel. DEFINITELY one to avoid for all travellers who like a clean place to stay.
