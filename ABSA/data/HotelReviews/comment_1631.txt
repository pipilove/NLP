underwhelmed by the W

we stayed there for 3 nights in july. put me in the over priced/trendy camp.the service was hit and miss. the check in was incredibly slow. however, we did find the staff to be friendly and helpful.yes, the bed and plasma tv are great, but everything else about the room was average.$30 a night for valet parking was a bit of a shock. all in all, i you pay more than $150/night to stay in this hotel, you're not getting your money's worth.
