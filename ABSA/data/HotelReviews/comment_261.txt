nice hotel good location for wkend trip

I found this hotel was ok. The location is excellent for a trip to Amsterdam only a short walk to everywhere you need to go. I think it was rated as a 4 star but i would have thought it's more like a 3 star hotel. The breakfast is very expensive 20 per person. The rooms are a decent size and were clean and comfy. The decor was just a bit outdated. Apparently hotels in amsterdam are quite expensive so I'd say this would be a standard 4 star over there.Dam square is lively and there is lots going on there during the day. You would be right next to shopping areas, canal tours, madamme tussauds, close to red light district and anne frank house. Van gogh museum is about 20 mins walk away. Also big tip for anyone don't get a taxi from the airport. It cost us 50 euro and was only about 15 mins in a taxi. I don't think they are regulated so they charge what they like. There is a train from central station that will take you straight to the airport for a few euro. Its a few hundred yards from the hotel.
