Absolutely Awful - be warned!

What a complete disaster! We went to Amsterdam for the weekend on the 7th of July 2007. My friend had been there before and had recommended it. He was soon wishing he hadnt! Our initial problem happened when it came to check in. We arrived at 1.30pm and went to reception to check in. We were told that our room would not be available until 3pm. We didnt think that was a major problem, so we went off for a stroll around the city centre until it was ready. We came back to the hotel at 3.30pm (thinking we had given them enough time) - but apparently we hadnt. We were told to come back at 5pm. No major hassle, we went off again and came back at 5.30pm and when we went to reception again we were told that the room wasnt ready. Each time we were queuing at reception to talk to someone, we were made wait at least 15 mins on each occasion. There was around 4 people in the queue ahead of us and everyone was fuming at the amount of time it took to deal with queries...there was one elderly couple at the desk and they were freaking at the service that they were being given. Sloppy service, thats the only way to describe it. The management of the hotel dont seem to be intestered in having smooth check in/out processes - because of the length of time it was taking to complete tasks that other hotels seems to complete in seconds. Whats all the drama for? The room itself was just ordinary, a little bit too ordinary for the prices we were paying. When I had a shower, water was appearing on the floor inthe bedroom! The hotel lobby smelt of old carpet, it was a bit run down. If you get to go there, have a look at the canopy outside the main entrance, its patched up with sellotape!! I really pity the staff who are working there, cause they are working for an organisation who dont put the customers first - all they want is your money. You are going to be disappointed in this hotel, so save yourself the hassle by staying somewhere else. Its not worth it.
