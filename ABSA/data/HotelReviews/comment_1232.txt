Wow what a surprise

From reading about a zillion reviews before booking a hotel for myself and my 14 yr old daughter to spend a weekend shopping at Union Square in SF, I was expecting a small but quaint, fairly clean room with a great location. I got all of that, but the room wasn't just fairly clean it was spotless. I accidently spilled a 1/2 gallon of bottled water on the carpet and anyone who has spilled something on carpet knows you blot it up, not wipe it up, well, I grabbed a couple of bathtowels and started blotting... the towels were soaked but quess what?? NO DIRT, NONE. The carpets had to have been cleaned or the towels would have been dirty. I was impressed the room smelt clean when we first entered, and it was. The location was excellent for shopping with my teenager and the valet parking was included with the room, so we didn't have to fight traffic, we just bought a three day muni pass and zoomed around town on the cable cars. The people where very helpful in the hotel and one of the elevators was broken and being repaired, but our wait for an elevator at the longest busiest time was never more than 5-6 minutes top. The price was great, the service was great and the room clean, it was a safe location, and for the price you cannot get a better deal.
