Very Disappointed

I was very disappointed by the service of the hotel staff, and the accomodations. Upon arrival we were not greeted by a staff welcoming us, but rather rebuffed for having 2 bags per person for a party of 4. The hotel was not ready to put us in our room, and offered no suggestions for tourists. This hotel was best suited for locals, not international travelers. Finally, I left a laptop computer when I check out. The hotel confirmed they had found it, and would ship to me at my cost. After a delay of a few days, I contacted them again, and they stated that they thought they had my laptop, but it was something else. The hotel is conveniently located to some interesting activities and attractions around Plaze de Cantalun...there are also other/ better hotel options than this one in the area. I would not recommend staying at this hotel.
