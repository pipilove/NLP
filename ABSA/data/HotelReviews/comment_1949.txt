Make it your first choice for a stay in Sydney

I regularly stay at the Swissotel for work purposes, I have stayed at most of the major hotels in Sydney some good some terrible. The Swissotel is always my first choice to stay, whatever they do it seems to be smooth and easy with no hassles.I stayed once and the aircon did not work, no hassle they upgraded me next stay at no extra cost.So what would I say if asked about the Swissotel.Make it your first choice for a stay in Sydney
