WONDERFUL SURPRISE!!

We loved the Jazz, stayed there for two nights November 10 and 11, 2004. Excellent central location, great modern, functional bedroom overlooking busy street, but no street sounds when window closed. The Jazz provided us with a great breakfast. Checkin and checkout were troublefree, staff very helpful. We'd not hesitate to use the Jazz again, or to recommend it to friends. We had learnt about the Jazz from its Trip Adviser rating. It earned its high rating, in our minds!
