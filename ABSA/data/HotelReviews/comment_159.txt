Nothing Special

We stayed at the Victoria hotel for a weekend for a friend's 40th birthday. No doubt the hotel is in an amazing location if visiting for a weekend. The staff were very friendly and the concierge helped with directions and places to go on the first night we arrived. The rooms however were not up to four star standard. I know some reviews mentioned renovations but our rooms did not reflect this - the carpet was worn so too was the furniture - the beds were old and uncomfortable and there was mould in the bathroom. Apart from the mould the room was clean. We did not eat breakfast - there are plenty of places just outside the hotel that serve breakfast till late and 20 euros is pretty steep!We got a deal on Expedia so paid about æ‹¢100 per room per night - for the state of the room it is overpriced even at our discount rate. If I visited again I would stay outside of the centre - the hotels are better value and Amnsterdam is not a big place and most places can be travelled to by foot.
