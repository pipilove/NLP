Very good hotel but the marketing is skewed

This is a very good hotel. It's a modern, recently designed and built establishment in an excellent, central location. You're within 10 minutes' walk of the Louvre and just 15 minutes of the Opera. From that point of view it could hardly be bettered.The service is second to none and the breakfasts are very good. I think breakfast is probably very expensive even by Paris standards, so if you want to save money, you should know that within a few minutes' walk of the hotel there are some very pleasant cafes on the Rue de Rivoli.I booked on the internet and upgraded my booking because I wanted to give my wife a treat. I have to say that I was disappointed on several counts:1. When I arrived the staff appeared unaware of the upgrade or what it entailed;2. The upgrade was supposed to give me a bottle of champagne on arrival, but it was not to be had until asked for;3. The room was small. I think this was the biggest disappointment. If they offer an upgrade for couples I think that the room ought to be a priority - but it was so small that my wife and I had to negotiate verbally before getting out of the bed because there was so little room. The bathroom was almost as big as the bedroom. Furthermore, I'm not pleased that the first thing they said to me when I checked in was that I could upgrade my room for 80 euros. Well, if you've already upgraded your booking, why should you have to upgrade again if you want a decent-sized room?So on balance, this is a very good hotel, but their marketing is, I think, annoyingly skewed. Either you upgrade, and you upgrade properly, getting a decent room, or you don't. It's as simple as that. But to have several layers of upgrade, none of them understood by the staff, seems to me crazy.
