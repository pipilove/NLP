Disneyland Hotel Paris

Great Location, great bell service they were very helpful on arrival and departure. Front desk was slow, really really slow and only two persons working.Our room was ok, 1327, they need to go a good clean toe nails and dirt behind the bedside table. Everything else OK.Room service food is really really bad and not worth the money, the soup was from a tin, the pasta had a sauce from a tin, I asked then why they cannot make a fresh sauce, they said they cannot.The California Grill, 50 euro plate of fish and it was burned, there as well they could not make fresh sauce for a pasta. The veal really salty and served in a small dish not worth 43 euros. There cheese trolly well, the smallest selection I have ever seen in the country famous for cheese, 5 types of cheese.They had a good wine list.Good service Inventions well its self service and it feels like front canteen from mash. If you can take any food without being pushed aside by hungry fellow guests, its ok, but at 50 euros per head its not worth it. Whats makes it worth it for the kid are Mickey and freinds who really are fun for the kids.Hotel breakfast is ok.Whats worth the money only to stay at this hotel is Mickey and Friends every morning from 7.30am until 11am, and the Hotel is 20 meters from the Park.After spending 2500 euros in 3 days, they charged us 65 euros extra to be allowed to check out at 12.30 instead of 11am, It feels like its all take from the Hotel and they give nothing.
