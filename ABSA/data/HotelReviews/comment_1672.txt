Not sure

Old building, remodeled, and it shows. Sleeping room was relatively small. Stand-alone closet with short space for hanging garments. No sitting chairs, just a weird desk chair that did not elevate. Heating system is a window AC unit that has to be shut off at night or guests will roast. Tiny bathroom with small glass shelf above tiny stainless steel railroad car sink. Gap between the shelf and wall that allows small items to drop to the floor. Toilet is undersized round bowl. And toilet paper holder mounted to block a person's leg. Bed was awful, saggy thing. Nice lobby with uncomfortably low furniture. Interesting blow up artsy photos on all doors. Appearance like discount W. Convenient to US Court House (across the street). Convenient to shopping area. Our weekend price was reasonably low. One night is about all we could take. Next time, a different choice, I am sure. Most pleasant memory is gull that sat on the window sill, begging through the glass for food.
