An overpriced disappointment!

Booked this hotel via Continental. Stayed two nights in June 2006. Was very disappointed to find they had dropped the Le Meridien brand, but wonder if it wasn't the other way around! I paid â‚¬169 per night (over $200/night) for a room with two skinny single beds. Unfortunately Amsterdam in June is well overbooked and didn't have much choice. Needless to say, that price didn't include breakfast. Also housekeeping NEVER changed my towels/sheets despite repeated requests at the front desk. The desk also forgot about my wakeup call which I requested in person. The street noise was also very loud until the wee hours and they wouldn't let me smoke in the room! The staff seems to have given up on making this place hospitable. So why bother staying here? Until this place is overhauled, look elsewhere. Two stars at best...
