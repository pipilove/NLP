PPlease do not waste yourmoney on this hotel!

Please, whatever you do, spend your money elsewhere. I was supposed to stay at this hotel for FOUR NIGHTS (April 4-8,2004). However, due to the coldness/unaccommodating nature of the front desk staff, as well as a room that was in bad need of a paint job (Room 523), and after TWO UNFORTUNATE NIGHTS, I finally got smart and decided to CHECKOUT. The room was superbly located (5th floor, balcony view of Paseo de la Gracia), but the room was horrible. Absolutely, UNACCEPTABLE in its' presence. The only good thing about the hotel? Fifteen Euros, flat fee cost for internet use/business center, for entire length of stay. I was so happy to leave, and go to the wonderful rooms, and spirit of the people at HOTEL AXEL!! Half the cost, and by U.S.A. standards, a truly WONDERFUL HOTEL.
