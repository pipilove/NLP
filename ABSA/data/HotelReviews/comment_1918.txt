Booked directly with the Four Seasons quite some months before going- got 4 nights for the price of 3 which according to the receptionist was excellent value.Had a fabulous time there- lovely room with plently of space- all the staff were very helpful, polite and friendly. Ate at the cafe restaurant on the 2nd floor once- food good and prices fine. Also had room service- quick and again, reasonable.Spa was excellennt- good treatments and pleasant staff. Fitness area also good- made use of the outdoor spa every night- was dark but heated so that was fine.Had a great stay- recommend it to all- great location too.
