Got Euros Read On

In planning a 5 day trip to Amsterdam, our main hotel could only accomdate us for 4 nights, so out of last minute planning we could find a room at the Park Hotel. Well got a nice room: very modern, sleek, and comfortable. And then the troubles began:  1). Temperature: the room became very cold and there was no way to turn up the heat. So, an hour later, the staff provided us with a space heater that warmed the room.2). Leaky shower: the shower had a glass partition from the toilet that let water leak onto the floor. We had to use 5-6 towels to mop up the mess. 3). Sewer Stench: for some reason, we notice a foulstench in the bathroom that began in the morning. Did not dare determine if it was coming from the toilet or shower. In summary, this was not what we expected for the $300 price.
