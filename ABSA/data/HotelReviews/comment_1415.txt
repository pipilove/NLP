ABSOLUTELY THE BEST!

If you're looking for something fancy schmancy with a swimming pool and fitness center, forget the Nob Hill Motel on Pacific Ave. But, if you're looking for sparkling rooms in a great neighborhood, AAA approved, reasonable, quiet, safe, free parking, continental breakfast, fantastic owners that were extremely helpful, free pick up for tours, three blocks from cable cars, one block from buses, great restaurants in three block area, Shanghai Kelly's bar, etc., then this is for you!! We stayed there 7 nights and would stay there again, without a doubt. By the way, while visiting SF, MAKE SURE you see Beach Blanket Babylon (see their website) and get tix in advance. Also bike the Golden Gate Bridge into Sausalito, take the early EVENING tour of Alcatraz and purchase a MUNI pass (good on cable cars, buses, trolleys); don't miss visiting Fortune Cookie Factory in Chinatown, DeYoung Museum in GG Park, Muir Woods/Wine Country tour, and spend hours enjoying the sea lions at Fisherman's Wharf. What a great city --wear comfortable shoes!!!
