Great Location

Great location - just one block out of Circular Quay. Walking distance to the Opera House, Sydney Harbour Bridge, and the Rocks. It was easy to find breakfast on a weekday since it was in the financial district. We walked to the Rocks most evenings for dinner. Good access to city buses and the train. The room was a good size for a city hotel but nothing spectacular to write about. The concierge was very helpful in selecting tours and restaurants. On our next visit I would probably consider staying in the Rocks - that neighborhood has much more character.
