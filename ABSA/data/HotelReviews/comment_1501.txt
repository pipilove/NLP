Disappointing

Amenities Part of the reason we selected the hotel was because it advertised having a pool and hot-tub. The Pool ended up being so dirty that the sides, above the water were black with grime and people had taken to scratching profanities into it. Otherwise the rest of the pool had dark dirt stains covering the bottom and sides.The hot-tub was luke warm at best and just like the pool it was filthy. We informed the desk about both the pool and the hot-tub and they stated they were cleaned regularly and were operating as they should. These statements indicated to us they did not care about what we thought once they had our money.A further complaint was the difficulty in finding information related to their parking accommodations which turned out to cost an additional $27/day.The rooms themselves were adequate although the marble in the bathrooms could have used a thorough cleaning as they had dirt and rust stains.The best part about the hotel was the location as it was in walking distance of the Space Needle, The Public Market and for us Qwest Field.This hotel is good if you are just looking to catch some sleep but you do not worry too much about quality. If you want to soak in the hot-tub or swim in the pool at the end of a long day look for other accommodations.
