Don't Be Misled

I booked this hotel based on the reviews on this site for Labor Day Weekend. Thought the reviews were to good to be true based on other guides that listed this hotel.As I quickly learned on arriving, this is just a basic budget hotel. The hotel was clean and the staff was accomodating but they appeared to be young inexperienced college students.From the studio descriptions listed I expected a kitchenette with a full sized refrigerator and a stovetop. Instead it was your usual small hotel refrigerator and a small microwave. Don't think you are going to get a studio like other hotel chains that offer a studio.The continental breafast was pathetic. The main item being offered were boiled eggs (for breakfast no less). The only thing I had at breakfast was a glass of guava juice.I thought the price was rathar high at $155 a night but I reasoned that if I was receiving a studio at a splendid hotel it would be a bargain. Instead I received the basic hotel room with no room service ,no view to speak of and an uncomfortable bed. To me it was worth about $90. You must know that the area this hotel is in is not the best. I tried to find a good restaurant on Universty Ave. in the area and felt unsafe with some of the individuals that approached me on the street for money.I checked out after the first night. Ended up staying at a Homewood Suites near downtown (see review) at about the same price and was completely satisfied.In conclusion I would say that unless you need to be near UW or Safeco Headquarters you probably can find a better hotel.
