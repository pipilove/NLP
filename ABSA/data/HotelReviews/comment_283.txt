dishonest management

We stayed at Hotel Seven Bridges for a few nights in October 2004. The evening before we departed I went to the owner and said I wanted to settle our bill as we were leaving early the next morning. He said he did not have time to do it then. The next morning , October 8, 2004, as we were leaving for the airport to return home to Portland, I went to the owner and paid him the 240Euros due. I paid him in cash and asked for a receipt. He acted indignant and said he was out of receipts and did not have time to go get more since he had to run the place alone. As we had a plane to catch, I was unable to do anything other than write down the amount I paid him in my spiral notebook. I signed a blank VISA paper when we checked in and I was told it would be destroyed if I paid cash,WHICH I DID. Imagine my surprise when VISA said I owed for three nights lodging and they had a signed receipt for 10/21/04......ten days after we were home and back at work! I think the Seven Bridges acted fraudulently and advise youto be ware.
