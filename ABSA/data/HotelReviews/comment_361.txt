Very mixed feelings

This is place is far overpriced ! And beside the spectacular prices, they charge you for basically ANYTHING else......and they know their prices. Be prepared to pay 4 Euro for an in-room coffee made yourself by the coffeemaker in the room (and then add the tax to it) or 7 Euro for a coke taken from you minibar (again without the tax). Anything room service brought to the room will be applicable to a 6 euro delivery charge on top of the already high prices. Just to give you an idea !At these rates you would expect it to be flawless. But it's far from that. When we arrived in the room the toilet was far from clean and contained stains of sh...t from the previous guest. We immediately called the manager on duty who, after 25 minutes, arrived to the room. He acted shocked and advised to send housekeeping right away. This took another 30 minutes and when the girl left, nothing was changed. Again we called the manager and came up to the room with the Head Housekeeping. Naturally both were shocked and housekeeping was called again. Then things were cleaned as they were supposed to !As a gesture for the inconvenience we received a dinner for two ! And that's where the hotel came in place for it's 5 star status. The food all over the hotel is simply great. From dinner to breakfast. Absolutely great quality.Be also aware that the hotel is extremely noisy. Being on the 25th floor, we still hear traffic and people partying on the beach for almost the whole night.All in all a disappointing experience and not something we would consider a second time !
