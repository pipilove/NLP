They need to fire the staff and start over.

The hotel itself is very nice. Stylish decor. A great location. But the staff ruined my stay for me. We had planned to stay one night at Hotel Jazz and then travel down to Sitges. But upon waking up on the day that we were supposed to check out, we decided we wanted to spend two more nights in Barcelona. I called the front desk and asked if we could stay for two more nights. The woman told us no problem. After a day of sightseeing we arrived back at the hotel to find that our card key to our room did not work. We inquired at the front desk. Apparently the computer had checked us out. While one clerk checked on the matter, another walked over to inform us that if we wanted to stay the night, we would have to pay a higher rate (40 euro higher) and that it was impossible for us to stay the next night. We informed him that we had cancelled our reservation in Sitges after being told that we could stay two more nights. After much back and forth, this very unpleasant man agreed to call the woman that we had spoken to that morning to confirm that we had been told that we could stay two more nights. He picked up the phone, spoke to someone is Spanish, then turned to the other clerk and said OK. No apology. Just attitude.
