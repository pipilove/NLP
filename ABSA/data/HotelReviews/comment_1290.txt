The Rock!!

The hotel is very nice. Its also in a fantastic location in San Francisco. We were however very disappointed in the quality of the mattress. We stayed here four nights-by the end of the trip my back was hurting!! I really would expect a better mattress than a rock (the mattresses in Alcatraz were more comfy than the hotel)!! The pillow was very nice! The continental breakfast at the hotel was awful! It was cereal, cold muffins, croissants, and some fruits.
