Shady Hotel

There were problems from the start. Upon arrival we were forced to upgrade or leave the hotel due to lack of rooms. A day later, the hotel's water supply cut off until 12 pm, this happened several times. The toilet had to be fixed about twice which is really annoying. There is black mold in the bathrooms and around the airconditioning. The pool is tiny and covered in black mold. The only positive thing this hotel can offer is space.The manager at the time was just bad, first initial J.
