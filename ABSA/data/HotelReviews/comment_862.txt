Too less for the price

Below our room was a very noisy restaurant, so we didnt sleep well. The staff wasnt too friendly and the management neither. The furniture is nice and i really like design hotels. But even it is only one year old the roomy look very used still.The prices are very high so I wouldnt recommend.
