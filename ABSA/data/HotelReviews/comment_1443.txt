Great location

Stayed at the Parc 55 for one night on Saturday, June 24. The lobby is beautiful and the service from the valet and front desk staff is very good. Overall, the property is very clean and appears to be well maintained. My room on the tenth floor was also clean, fairly large for a S.F. property, had a decent view and was well appointed. The bed was actually very comfortable. I did by the way ask for a complimentary upgrade at check in so its possible that my room was a little nicer than the regular rooms but you often don't know if you really are being upgraded unless you are a regular and/or are very familiar with the property. I did not dine at the hotel so I cannot comment about the quality of the food at the Parc however I had a drink in the sports bar which was quite small but like any other hotel sports bar. The Parc 55 is definitely one of the most strategically located hotels in S.F. in my opinion. Union Square, shopping and great restaurants are all very close and within easy walking distance. There is also an abundance of stores with wine, food, etc. all around the area if one wanted to get supplies or perhaps their own wine/beer. One disappointment however was the absence of an in room refrigerator and mini bar which made having any cold snacks or beverages on hand impossible. The Parc 55 is where the visiting baseball teams stay when they are in town to play the Giants (at least it used to be and I believe that this is still the case). All in all, I would stay here again in a heartbeat.
