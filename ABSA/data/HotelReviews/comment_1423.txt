An average Renaissance

The large 1980s marble lobby is probably the nicest part of this hotel. The 4 star rating should be 3.5. The room was large and clean with an ok bath (not luxurious by any means). We had a high floor so no city noise. Corridors are bright and newly carpeted. Our dealings with the hotel staff were minimal, so I cannot fairly comment on the service. Superb location near the Powell Street Cable Car, Nordstrom (and 2005 the new Bloomingdale's), Abercrombie, Gap, and two blocks away from Union Square with almost every luxury retailer you could want. BART within 30 yards and one block away is the Market Street trolly. However, San Francisco is loaded with beggers, panhandlers and homeless people. Interestingly, NONE of them are of Asain descent...ponder that. They seem to congregate near the subway area (big shock!) but are not aggressive. Not a plethora of restaurants near the hotel, and the doorman did advise (read: warn) us not to venture onto the streets toward the rear of the hotel. We took his advice and had a great safe trip. Fisherman's Wharf is little but T-shirt shops and mediocre tourist restaurants. Don't miss the cable car...even if there is a long line. One other item: The bus tours to the wine country are little more than sales pitches at the wineries to get you to buy their wines; highlight of that tour was 2 hours in the town of Sonoma.
