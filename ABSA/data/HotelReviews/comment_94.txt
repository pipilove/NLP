Over rated and over priced

This hotel was terrible. I can't believe it is rated 4 stars! Our room was old and dingy with nasty carpeting and broken down stained furniture. We were in a newer wing of the hotel that was probably built in the '60's or '70's but this room would be what you expect in a $50 a night motel in the US. Maybe the old wing is nicer?Besides the quality of the room, the staff was not friendly or helpful. The common areas were packed with attendees at two different conferences that were being held there as well as a number of tour groups that were being dropped off by bus.I assume these groups were getting BIG discounts compared to the $249 euro I was paying. The only thing good about this hotel was the location.
