Excellent modern hotel in an excellent location

Hotel turns out to be just as all the previous reviews have said - the goods and the bads. Good location close to but far enough from busy tourist areas, subway station right at door, good restaurants/cafes nearby, noisy main street, modern room and lobby, competitive rates compared with other hotels - good value for money.A laundry shop in the backlane of the hotel washes a bag of your clothes for 10 Euros that opens 9-1 and 4-8. I suspect the hotel itself sends its washings to the shop too - don't quote me on that :)
