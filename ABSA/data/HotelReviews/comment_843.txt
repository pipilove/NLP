Centrally location in such a huge city

Very nice modern hotel in Berlin, close to the ZOO Garden station for easy access to all public transportation within berlin. Located very close to a Bus or underground station, making getting to and from the airports (Tegel or Scheonfield) easy.The coolest thing about the stay was the view at breakfast, very clean breakfast bar, since it is all indoor on the top floor of the hotel with full wall glass windows facing the street.Internet access at the hotel was an added bonus.
