Great location, nice atmosphere

We arrived on an early flight - and the front desk happily checked us in before noon. The room was large with nice decor- flat screen tv, long window seat, cool bathroom, etc... The bed was super comfy- similar to the Westin beds. Location was great-- Pike Place market, Pioneer Square and other downtown attractions were all a very short walk away.We were also very pleased with the concierge's dinner recommendation- Flying Fish in Belltown.
