Lousy Hotel

Reasons why we will NEVER stayed at LuX 11, EVER AGAIN.Hotel staff is full of attitude. Concierge is not available 24 hours.The sink in the room is not practical at all. So is the shower. Water splashes everywhere whenever we take showers. No one is available to clean the daily garbage.No soundproof in the room. You can hear every single foot-step of people who live above you.Awful  Lousy!!!I WILL NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL AT ALL.
