the rooms very deplorable 2 bed one behind the other bathroom for midget

we arrive at 6 juny 2008 for 4 nights we order 2 double bed rooms - standard rooms. we receive rooms very deplorable the bed one behind the other and wall was between the bed. the bathroom so small maybe for midget. we ask every day at the reception to change the rooms but its was fully booking. no air conditioner at the hotel including dining room. its was 31 degree - very hot.
