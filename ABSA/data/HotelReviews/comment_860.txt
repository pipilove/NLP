Modern Hotel fairly well located for sightseeing

Stayed here for 5 nights on sightseeing holiday of Berlin.The hotel sits on the site of the former Berlin Wall and a 15 minute walk away from Checkpoint Charlie. Underground station nearby too. The immediate area around the hotel is not appealing, but for the price, it is well located for those who prefer to walk to the sights. A more expenisive Marriott is better located but is twice the cost!The hotel itself is understandably modern and has underground secure parking for residents. The rooms are comfortable and the shower was pretty good too. Breakfast is a good quality hot and cold buffet.However, it was strange that guests are charged to use the communal internet computers.If you're here for the sightseeing, then this is a pretty reasonable hotel to stay.
