Horribly unbelievable!

When you choose a Four Seasons you basically think (if nothing else) that you can't go wrong, that you aren't risking much because it's a Four Seasons!One of our honeymoon stops was Sydney so we booked the Four Seasons. After a long haul flight from Tokyo via Singapore we were pretty anxious to get some rest.Upon arrival it didn't look like a lobby fit for a hotel of that category.We were also not impressed with the old and ill-maintained elevators. But the real shock came from the room. It was so small that our 3 pieces of luggage barely fit anywhere. The room had no decorative objects except for a plastic alarm clock from the 80's... The window was tiny so the harbour view was almost non-existent. The bathroom was proportional to the room.We were so appaled with the room that we immediately went to the business center to use the internet and look for another hotel and left.We didn't try any of the restaurants but we did have a look at the spa and its menu which was very limited. The outdoor pool consists of a small tank at the back of the hotel.Definitely not going back to that hotel and have learnt the lesson about making general assumptions about hotel chains.
