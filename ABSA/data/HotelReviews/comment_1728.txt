Comparison: Grand Hyatt

We moved from the Sheraton (conference location) to the Grand Hyatt for a few more days in Seattle so here is a bit of information about each of them.They are both very comfortable and convenient. Our room at the Sheraton was big and bright but the bathroom was pretty small and a little dated. The Grand Hyatt room was much smaller and very dark but the bath was gorgeous. It was huge and new but the light was so dim it was really difficult to apply makeup. The amenities at the Sheraton are worthless - the Grand Hyatt was much better (but not as nice as Sofitel).Bed at the Sheraton was very comfortable but the Hyatt was incredible. Plus, they had a neat electronic room-darkening shade that really helped in the morning. They also had an electronic privacy button rather than the little tag you put outside the door. It was very quiet at both locations.They both charge $10 for in-room Internet, which I think is nickel  dime stuff considering the price of the room. The Hyatt (I think - and maybe the Sheraton, too) also tacks on a charge for the morning newspaper. You can choose not to get it, but you have to do so at registration, I believe.The only bar at the Hyatt is the Ruth Chris' bar - when we tried to take a glass of wine upstairs to our room, we were told that was not usually allowed, but if we were discreet, it was okay. We were successful, but I didn't appreciate feeling like a crook to take my drink upstairs! Did not attempt this at the Sheraton bar, so can't say about that.Overall, both hotels were very good experiences and I can recommend either. I'd say, go with the best price, unless a real modern look is important to you. Then go with the Hyatt.
