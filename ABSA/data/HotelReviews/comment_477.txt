Lessons in customer service ! DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL.

I have travelled extensively in recent years and have had many enjoyable weekend breaks at various priced hotels. As a special treat me and 18 of my friends decided to do something a bit special and stay at the Grand Marina. It was the worst experience of my life. The service received from the staff was nothing short of offensive, the manager was the rudest person I have ever met in my life.I personally will never be returning to the Grand Marina and I will make it my lifes mission to makesure nobody else does either !!!
