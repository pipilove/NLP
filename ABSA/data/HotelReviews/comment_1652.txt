Never again

We checked in at the W to find that one of our adjoining rooms was not quite ready yet. We felt that was fine since we were able to use one room to get ready in for dinner out. When we arrived back at the hotel after dinner they said the adjoining room was not going to be available and so four of us were all crammed into one king bed room. One had to sleep on the little sofa and one on a rollaway. The lack of compassion by the front desk was unbelievable. Room service Sunday morning took 1 1/2 hours to arrive and obviously had been left sitting for quite some time. Retriving our bags from storage was also an incredibly long wait. Never again.
