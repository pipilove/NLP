Bad

We thought great hotel when we booked this via there website. We went 29th May to 31st May. This was our 4th Trip to the great city.When we got there. NOT a nice hotel at all. Our room was meant to be a superior room. It was small and dusty,not clean at all. We complained to the check in desk. The woman was rude and not helpful. When we did get help, they offered a suite for an extra 20 Euros a night. We looked at the suite, the room walls had kids drawing marks over then, it too was unclean,it had no view. Not worth any extra money.The problem was we had already paid, so had no choice to stay. Only 2 nights. The porter etc, didn't help us with our bags. Despite my girlfriend being disabled. All in all a very disappointed hotel.
