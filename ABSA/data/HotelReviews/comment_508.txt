Most horrible of vacation!

After reading other reviews, we selected the Pulitzer using Booking.com. We booked a double with breakfast for one night. On arrival, we were taken to the smallest room in the whole hotel which we were assured would be quiet. This room could never have been intended for 2 people of any persuasion. We literally had to move the chair in order to get to the doorway. We were told there were no other rooms available.The disaster was later. The air/heat did not function. It was cold outside, but HOT in this room. We could not open the window, due to the noise outside from Playa Catalunya, even though we were told this room was quiet. With the window closed, the parties went on until about 4:00 am and this was a Wednesday night. The dry hot evening was unbearable.The breakfast included was just OK.Conditions in the hotel are not good. Paint was gashed all over the place and it generally did not appear to be clean. The staff were pleasant.We would not book again in any season!
