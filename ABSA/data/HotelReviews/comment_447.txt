Outstanding Hotel

The Montecarlo is outstanding. After taking the overnight train from Seville, we arrived at the hotel around 9:30 am. To our surprise, we were able to get a room immediately. The staff spoke excellent English and were extremely professional and helpful, immediately taking care of any request we had. The location couldn't be better, right on Las Ramblas. The room was very spacious with a large bathroom with a jacuzzi tub. For a great light meal,breakfast or lunch, it was great to wander down to the large market and get beautiful large fresh strawberries and wonderful pastries from the vendors.
