Great location, Big price, Small rooms

Location, location, location... When myself and my friend walked out of the centraal station the Victoria hotel was one of the first sights we saw. The location of this hotel is excellent, very central to all the main tourist attractions. Amsterdam is an expensive city depending on where you choose to eat and drink. Around the red light district, beside the hotel and at Dam square you can expect to pay over the top prices for your drink and (often) bad food. If you turn left when exiting the hotel you can expect to find a prettier, quieter, more picturesque side of Amsterdam with nicer cafes, bars and restaurants offering more reasonable prices for better food and drink. The hotel ifself is nice, typically 4 star from its exterior and interior. The 2 bars are pleasant and the lobby and reception live up to its rating. The bedrooms are clean but small. Very small for the price we had to pay. The room was at the back of the hotel and the view was of another room 2 metres opposite. The room was very stuffy and we had to have the air conditioning on 24/7, the weather was under 20c for the time of our stay so it wasnt particularly warm outside. So there are pros and cons to staying at the victoria hotel. While the location is superb the rooms are far too small for the price we had to pay and the next time i go to Amsterdam i would be more likely to choose a hotel further away from the red light district and the tourist trap around centraal station. Plus there are many better things to spend your money on in Amsterdam, enjoy!
