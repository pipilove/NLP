Disappointing

We stayed in the Victoria Hotel for New Year's Eve and our stay was extremely disappointing. This hotel does not classify as a four star hotel as it is rated. Many of the items listed on the hotel website do not appear in the room, i.e. trouser press, safes, etc. The state of our bathroom (which was tiny) was embarassing and is worse than any hotel we have ever stayed in due to the extent of the mould in the shower and also the fact that you could only spend limited time in the shower because the water did not drain away for ten minutes or more. We stayed for four nights (with prices ranging between Euros 99-210 plus tax) and not once during our stay was our bed linen changed and despite a call to ask when we were leaving our room on New Year's Day, they failed to clean the room and simply left new towels on the door handle. There were also chips out of the door and several of the lights weren't working. Whilst the hotel staff were friendly, they did not assist in moving us to anther room despite our request and I would not recommend a stay in this hotel. The lobby looks inviting, however, our room was less than acceptable and it is difficult to understand how this hotel can be rated as four star.
