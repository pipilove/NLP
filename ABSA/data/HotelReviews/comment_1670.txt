Good location, but with major room for improvement

The good: - The location of this hotel is great for those staying in downtown Seattle. You're within walking distrance of nearly all attractions and major business destinations. - Good selection of channels on the TV- As with most W hotels, the bed is comfy . . . . but . . . . The bad: - My wife got bed bugs bites during our stay. Seriously. Obviously this is a major area of concern. I didn't realize that bed bugs were a real phenomenon, but apparently they are. - The valet/garage situation is terrible. Their loading area is far too small for the type of traffic (hotel guests and hipsters at the bar), and so you can wait 5 minutes to valet park your car. The parking staff tries really hard, but they just can't keep up in the cramped space. - Service was spotty. Some people were really helpful, others were totally indifferent. - Lousy water pressure in the shower. Indifferent: I always have mixed feelings about W hotels. I like the hip vibe in the lobby, but there are simple things that feel contrived. For instance, the lighting in the hallways is so dark, you can't see the room numbers. Admittedly a small detail, but sometimes you feel like convienece and ease come at the expense of cool. I don't know . . . maybe I'm just getting old.
