Good for Paris Standards

At first sight it doesn't look nice nor attractive but it turned to be an excellent choice for Paris hotel standards. I was a bit scared we were on the first floor, our room facing the noisy and busy street below, but the isolation is perfect and you can hear nothing. Beds are quite comfortable, bathroom is spotless. One block away from the subway (Pyramides). In front of the hotel there is an excellent japanesse restaurant which seems to be a major hit with the locals. Long lines for entering, so you should try it at night. Hotel vicinity is not the best but it's ok. Full of oriental eating places.
