Pretty good if you are a heavy sleeper

As my favorite hotel was fully booked, I tried the Relais Bosquet as it was located to where I needed to be albeit a bit more expensive. The rooms are small but adequate. Skip the 15 euro breakfast and walk out of the hotel, turn left, walk 15 steps and you are at a wonderful bakery! Walk to Rue Cler for coffee at any number of cafe's.The rooms are very clean, and the bathrooms are updated. The free Wi-Fi works great..I never turned on the tv. The shutters do a great job of keeping out the light. My work in Paris kept me out until usually midnight, so I wanted to sleep in until at least 9 a.m. This is where the hotel loses points. The doors are very heavy and start slamming at around 7:00 a.m. They are very loud and woke me up each morning.My other complaint is that the night desk people are uninpsired to help customers. They are there because they have to be. Not even a good evening when I came in at night. On the other hand, Christian and Frederica were very helpful.I would suggest another hotel if you want to sleep past 7:00. If you want to get up early, and hit the sites, the hotel is adequate.
