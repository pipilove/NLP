Don't need a map to find it!

Recently stayed there as part of a group of 21 blokes on a stag trip. Very convenient location to explore the eastern side of the city. Rooms are functional and business-like, with amazing views over the city (I was on the 16th foor).Breakfast was typical European fare; not the best I've experienced because of the vast numbers of people the hotel caters for, but a good range and perfectly adequate enough to start the day.Thoroughly recommend it for large groups needing a city base because of its 24hr access. The best feature was the fact that wherever you are in Berlin you can see the hotel; especially important at the end of a big night out!
