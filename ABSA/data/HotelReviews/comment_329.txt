Great location...but disappointed

We booked this hotel through our cruise line and felt comfortable that our 6 star cruise line would choose a very fine hotel for our stay.First the positive: the breakfast was excellent (one of the nicest we have ever had in Europe) and the location was very close to the information center, Ramblas, the tourist bus, and the Gaudi sites. We felt very safe walking in this area, even at night. We were to receive a prestige room and were expecting a room like the one pictured on the website. Instead, it was merely a classic room (the base room) with a balcony. The room and bathroom, while tastefully done, were quite small. Other cruisers, who stayed at various four star properties in Barcelona, and visited our room, said our room was not as nice as theirs and they paid considerably less. While the room wasn't miniscule, we paid for more, according to the picture, and expected more.Additionally, there was no concierge available and when we made restaurant reservations each night with the front desk , each night the reservations were wrong. The first night, the gentleman at the desk rang the restaurant we were told no reservations were needed and to go directly to the restaurant. THere was a long line and we had to wait for 40 minutes. The next night, even though we wrote out what we needed, the time of the reservation was wrong and we found out that they made the reservation an hour earlier than we requested. There was no confirmation as we are used to in a hotel of this class.Even room service was lacking, for two days they never emptied our waste paper basket.Lastly, porterage was supposed to be included in our package, yet our porter, who was very nice, told us he was not informed of this and wanted his tip. It was very embarrassing.We have stayed at a number of four and five star hotels and were disappointed at the poor service levels and value for our money. It is certainly not what one expects of a hotel of this calibre.
