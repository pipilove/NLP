Altamont does it right!

My husband and I like to stay in boutique hotels and B  B's when we travel international. The Altamont has everything you would hope for in a hotel. Location, cleanliness, affordability, and a staff at their best. Alan and Sam were always available to answer our questions; they treated us as if you were a guest in their home. We could easily walk to anywhere in Sydney we wanted to go, and the restaurants around the hotel were terrific. Alan's a great reference for restaurant info. The room we stayed in was very clean, and the bed very comfortable. My husband loved the powerful shower. The continental breakfast was all you needed to get your day going. It as nice to have a washer and dryed on site to do your laundry. The price was the icing on the cake. Also the fellows at the liquor store next door are fun to shoot the breeze with; they have some info for you too. If you don't stay at the Altamont when you're in Sydney, you've missed out on a great experience. In years to come if we're able to survive the 28 hour travel time from the States; we'll certainly book ourselves into the Altamont.
