Great Location

This hotel is situated two blocks from Fisherman's Wharf. All the tourist destinations (ferry to Alcatraz, restaurants, public transportation stops) are all within reasonable walking distance. The rooms themselves are quite small but clean. The staff was very friendly and accomadating with any questions or requests.
