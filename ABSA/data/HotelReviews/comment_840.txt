warning about this hotel!

We were booked to stay at this hotel for 3 nights and were looking forward to it, having read the positive reviews on this website. When we arrived we were told that the hotel has a policy of overbooking rooms and that they were overbooked and we were to be moved around the corner to the Olivaer Apart Hotel. It is a 3 star hotel and just as good she said. Although we did not get to see the Agon Opera, we know that it had been refurbished and had air conditioning. The Olivaer is a hotel much in need of refurbishment. The bed and shower room were clean, but the sofas in the room were very grubby, the sink was cracked, the shower door was hanging off. Also the carpets in the corridors were stained. Not my idea of a pleasant hotel. The breakfast was OK but it was a real bun fight with tables very close together and someone knocking the back of your chair every so often. There is no air conditioning and we were overlooking the main road so it was very noisy. Be aware that this might happen to you!
