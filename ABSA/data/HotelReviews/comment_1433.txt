Bad experience, not worth the upgrade, poor reception staff

Spend a few days at Grand hyatt , few in Monterey and back to SF for a few more at Parc 55. That was the worst experience of all.I did book quite in advance, requested a city view room, paid for an upgrade to a View room, mentioned that it was our honeymoon, and all I got when I arrived was a 21st floor room with a view at a construction yard at the back of the hotel! After numerous attempts to request a front city view I was turned down with typical answers such as we're fully booked, your room has a spectacular view, why do you want to change, try again tomorrow morning.Apart from overlooking the construction yard and hearing all the noice in the morning the stay was quite ok. Nothing special, rooms are big but the bed was not really comfortable, carpet was/looked dirty, bathroom ok, amenities ok. Cleaning staff were superdb but the front desk were really bad and counldn't be botherd. Same for the conierge who weren't very helpful and looked quite bored just sitting there.The hotel caters for a lot of business travelers and lots of airline crews! Didn't bother with any of the bar/restaurants as the are so many at close proximity.Location was great though, oposite from the Shopping centre and the Bart/cable car stations that was very convenient.Our stay at the Grand Hyatt was so much better, great rooms and views, superb beds, nice touches such as an ipod docking station, great bath and bathroom products, a lot friendlier staff.Wish I had stayed there for all part of our SF stay.Not worth the view upgrade unless they can guarantee a city view. Other wise you get as bad view as you would get with a cheaper rate but on a higher floor!
