Relaxing Stay in a Great Location

The Sheraton Hotel is in a prime location in the heart of downtown Seattle. It is so convenient for shopping and an easy stroll away from the Pike Place Market. I have stayed at the hotel many times and the staff have always been professional and courteous. The opening of the new Pine Street tower and completion of the lobby renovations have added to the attractiveness of the hotel. The room decor is very comfortable and furnishings are well thought out. I really liked the new Bliss Mandarin Mint bath products.
