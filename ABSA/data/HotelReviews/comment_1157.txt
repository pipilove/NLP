not sure why so expensive

Nice and clean and perfectly located close to Eiffel Tower. Room was quite small with no tea/coffee making fascilities. The front desk weren't the most helpful. We borrowed an iron one day, but they didn't give us an ironing board. The next day they said they didn't have an iron, but eventually lent it to us anyway with a long lecture of all the problems they'd had with other guest burning the carpets and curtains. Couldn't help thinking it was due to them not giving out the ironing board with the iron in the first place. All in all much too expensive for what you get, but great location, although we tried figuring out if there really was any of their rooms with a view of the Eiffel Tower, and we don't think so, unless you have a very long neck or can look around corners.
