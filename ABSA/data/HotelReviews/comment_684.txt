Good but not great

I was stayed here from the 27th -the 31st of May. There are many positive things about the hotel. The location is wonderful. You are next to the Berlin Dom, the sea life center and the spree river. All other major attraction is about 15mins away. You can take the 100  200 buses which stop a block away from the hotel or just walk. The S-ban  The U-ban are also very close. This is a great starting point to explore the both east  West Berlin. The hotel staff is very fluent in English and very knowledgeable about the city and what's going on. The rooms are very clean and up to date with there fixtures. I stayed in a business class room on the sixth floor. You have a bed, 2 night tables, a TV (flat screen), well stocked mini bar and a safe. The hot has two restaurants, a bar, and a gym. Breakfast is served till 11 in the heat restaurant. The have a large variety of food which was great but if this is not included in your hotel package stay away. Its 25Euros per person other wise. A few things made my experience here good but not great. The lobby smelled. I think this was because of the spree river but there is a rotten egg smell that takes over at times. The smell never made it pass the lobby though so the room smelled fine. Though clean the rooms are a bit bare, they were a bit cold to me (some may like this). My bed was supposed to be a king but it was two twins put together. If you rolled you would fall through the cracks. There was no universal adapter in the room. They did provide me with one when I ask but in a 5* hotel I expected one to be there. Lastly housekeeping came to the rooms as early as 7:30. To solve this problem I put the Do Not Disturb sign up till I left the room in the mornings.
