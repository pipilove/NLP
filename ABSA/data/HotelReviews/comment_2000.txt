Terrible

There are a lot of reviews you can read here, so I'm not going to waste a lot of your time mixing words. All I would do is expand on the other negative reviews about this one star motel. I still can't believe I allowed them to take my money for what they delivered. They lived up to the Sheraton reputation. I guess only have myself to blame, as I was warned. Do yourself a favour, stay at the Four Seasons.
