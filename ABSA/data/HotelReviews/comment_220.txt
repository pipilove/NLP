fantastic secure hotel

Hello all,This is probably one of the best hotels in the city. First the front door has cameras on it and is manned 24/7 ( so no idiots trying to get in at all hours). The staff come and collect your bags so you don't have to tackel the stairs with them . The welcome is the friendlist we have ever had (and we have been to Amsterdam on several occasions and stayed in a diffrent hotel every time). So it is not the RITZ but you get a lovely clean room, secure and staffed 24/7 .The breakfast is a typical continenetal breakfast and the location is 3mins from Dam Square behined the palace and yet there is no noise to inferfear with your sleeping or other activerties. The flower market is 10 mins in one direction and the red light area is 10 mins in the other direction.We have already inquired about a reservation in November . We will be returning to this hotel and i would urge you all to try this hotel too.
