Look elsewhere!

We booked this hotel as a good deal was available on the internet and the location (bang opposite Central Station) was right. We found out why it was so cheap: it's covered in tarpaulins and scaffolding, and it appeared ours was not one of the rooms that has already been done up. Small, dim, wonky headboard. The breakfast was obscenely overpriced at 20 Euros for a very poor buffet selection, and a mouse scurried across the breakfast room while we were eating. Yes, we did raise these concerns with the management and no, they didn't do anything. Good location and great city, but try another hotel!
