Great Hotel and good location

Stayed at the Hotel Nadia this week with 16 other people. When booking a hotel for so many people you have to do your homework and I trawled through tripadvisor and was concerned finding that the standard of hotels in Amsterdam had a lot to be desired and prices were really unreasonable. Then I came across the Nadia which had great reviews and good prices and within minutes of a reservation request online I had prices and availability confirmed and even a phone call. My only concern was I was unable to pay a deposit and I know I had confirmation e-mails but a deposit gives you that piece of mind (just a suggestion).Upon arrival and during our stay we were looked after really well so full marks to the staff - Thank you. As in all hotels in Amsterdam the rooms are small but they had everything you need for a short city break and most importantly they were very clean.Breakfast was standard continental and available for 3 hours.The hotel is located in a great location just a few minutes walk from Dam Square and all of Amsterdam's attractions can be reached easily on foot.One place you must visit is the Ice Bar - 15 euros and includes a drink, but its the experience of standing in a deep freeze with glasses and seating made of ice and you get great coats and hats to wear !! If you have spare time go on the half day trip to the windmills of Zaanse Sans and then onto the cheese factory (don't buy the cheese - if you really want some its half price at airport) and then to fishing village of Volendam. In these few hours you see the real Holland. Osam at reception can help you organise this trip.
