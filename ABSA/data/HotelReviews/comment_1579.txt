Wonderful Stay

I had to stay at this hotel for two weeks for my job and the hotel was wonderful, the se\rvice was great the only mistake was one day the room was not clean when I returned that afternoon but the service desk quickly fix that error and offered my a free movie. My wife and I did a lot of walking and the hotel is in a great area of town. The Market and Mall are all in walking distance and if you wanted to take a long stroll you could even walk to the tower.
