Great location

Small hotel in a very good location. We got stuck on the ground floor behind reception with no key (the previous occupants had taken it with them).Room was clean and presentable. As others have mentioned it was a little small, but I don't see this as a negative thing.There were shutters on the windows and being a ground floor room we had to keep the shutters closed to maintain our privacy. This in turn meant we had no natural light coming in.The location is wonderful, the Eiffel Tower is very close, as is a Metro stop - so you can get around easily.
