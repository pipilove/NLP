Hotel 1898

My DH and I stayed here for 3 nights pre cruise 04/30/07- 05/03/07. We booked this hotel based on trip ad visor reviews. It is a reallygood hotel but not the best I have ever stayed at. We booked a superior room which was lovely, but very small with only one window looking out into the back court yard.The bathroom was really beautiful with a really cool shower and enormous bath towels. Very hard mattress but was so tired from walking all over Barcelona was able to sleep well. We did not eat the breakfast for 18 euros. Many places to eat around hotel. Ate at the Attic restaurant right across the street, need a reservation for sure. Next year when I return to BCN I will probably try another hotel there are many to choose from.
