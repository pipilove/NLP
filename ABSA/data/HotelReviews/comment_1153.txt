Absoulutely Fantastic

Something I have never done is write a review on a hotel before. After our extremely postive stay this place deserves full marks and is possibly the best city hotel my wife and i have stayed in, in Europe.Superb amenities, location, service. The rooms are really well put together and there are certainly no rough edges - believe me, my wife looked everywhere!!!We will definitely be returning to the Regencia in the future.
