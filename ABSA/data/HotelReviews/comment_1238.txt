Great overall value!

What a great value in a great location! I thoroughly enjoyed my one-night stay. Easy to get in and out of this hotel. Staff was very available and knowledgeable. I found everything very convenient about this hotel. Attractive interior. Seemed less crowded than other hotels in the area. Rooms are a bit small but cozy and just right for a short stay. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Just a smooth, pleasurable experience all around, and the value was great. I hope they continue to do a nice job with what they do!
