Consistently terrible service - not worth the cost

I wouldn't normally write reviews, however after having such a stay at the weekend I feel compelled to recommend to others not to waste their money and stay at this hotel. Having stayed in a fair few Ritz Carlton's and other 5* hotels around the world and in Spain, I must say the standard of service was a complete let down. Many events happened during our stay (no room available, lost bag, no cleaning of room, lost drinks), most staff were incompetant and blamed the hotel being busy, to be honest I didn't want an excuse each time there was problem but a route to solve it. At the end of the stay we were offered a free breakfast for our inconvenience, which they forgot to apply, another example of overslack behaviour. Definately would not stay in this hotel again, very suprised with the usual high standards of ritz carlton's that the resort was ran so badly.
