Stolen mobile phone.

Many people will continue to stay at this hotel because of its convenient location and cheap price, however if you can possibly avoid it please pay a bit more and stay at a nicer hotel. As an experienced traveller i chose this hotel for its location and based on stays in TL in Melbourne. Upon arrival the reception staff were unable to find my booking (which i made on expedia) and told me that they had no rooms available even though I had confirmation from Expedia. They then managed to find the booking but however had only 1 room left which was a smoking room and with twin beds.. The room is dark and on the second day a mobile phone which was inside a suitcase but unfortunately unlocked went missing... All in all not the best of experiences and if you do choose to stay here then take your chances and make sure you take all your belongings with you.
