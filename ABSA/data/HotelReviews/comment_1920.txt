Great place

I stayed at the four seasons in Sydney for 5 nights in early July. I really enjoyed everything about my stay here. The room was great (not large, but not too small - it was comfortable and very well maintained) I upgraded my room to room with a view of the opera house - the views of the circular quay and opera house were amazing. The location of the hotel is really unbeatable. The service that I received from every person at the hotel was very definitely first class. The concierge was extremely helpful with bookings and directions and front desk and restuarant staff were equally welcoming. I ate breakfast at the hotel everyday and the buffet was well done. I guess the only negative comment I could make is the cost of daily internet access is A$20 which seemed like alot to me - otherwise I felt like the hotel was a great value and I would definitely recommend it to anyone planning a visit to Sydney
