Excellent value

Having read mixed reviews for this hotel, we were very pleasantly surprised by the superb location and comfort of the Travelodge. It is twenty minutes brisk walk from the Opera House, and you can walk via Hyde Park and the Botanical Gardens without hardly touching the city itself in one direction, and fifteen minutes to Darling Harbour in the other. Both destinations are beathtaking with plenty of things to do and see. We stayed a total of fifteen nights with an 'Autumn Special' rate of 99 dollars a night, and we would have stayed longer if it had been possible. The staff were always helpful, the rooms clean, very comfortable, well made-up each day, with good showers, coffee making facilities and microwave, ironing facilities and laundries on two or three of the eighteen floors. This is a popular hotel and hence there are often groups arriving or departing from the reception area. Broadband was expensive for one hour (10 Au dollars) but only 20 dollars for 24 hours over 90 days. This was far more than we needed but very handy to have if you take your own laptop. There are internet PCs available also - and the broadband only works on this ground floor level. There are no restaurant facilities except for breakfast, but there is a vast range of eating places close by, with Darling Harbour offering a range of places and prices and views that would be hard to beat, especially at night. There are also pubs close by that offer bar meals and bistro options. We would thoroughly recommend this hotel if you have a modest budget and its central position would be hard to beat.
