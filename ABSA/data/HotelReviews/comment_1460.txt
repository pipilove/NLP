St. Francis is coasting on location

Obviously, great location that can't be beat... cool hotel history, too. Very nice lobby. Good breakfast in the Oak Room (but pricey). That's it! It's all downhill from there... front desk staff: SURLY  RUDE. (I've had much better service from airline staff checking in at the airport.) Historic rooms: dumpy, dingy, noisy,  musty... 2 star at best. (We heard every toilet flush as well as neighbors having sex... not good). We won't be back.
