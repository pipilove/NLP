A Wonderful Hotel

My husband and I stayed here for two nights. Before arrival, the concierge e-mails and offers to help with any needs you may have. I had him make dinner reserevations at Ruth's Chris and The Georgian at the Fairmont . He e-mailed me the reservations. At check in, we were informed that we were upgraded to a King Corner Suite on the 19th floor. We were also handed a envelope with the dinner reservations and a map with the restaurants locations. The view from our suite was fantastic. Looking west was the view of the water, north the Space Needle. Location, location, location. It does not get any better then the Hyatt. The first night we dined at Ruth's Chris, the waiter told us that the concierge was treating us to an appetizer. How nice. Of course the food was delicious. The suite was very clean, bed super comfortable, and the bathroom spacious with the beautiful white marble. We travel extensively as we are retired. The staff at the Hyatt are some of the best we have ever encountered.
