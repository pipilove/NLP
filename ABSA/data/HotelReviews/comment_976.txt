Nothing special

Contrary to the numerous rave reviews, I am somewhate surprised at the popularity of this hotel after staying there for a couple of evenings.The service was impersonal with a different person at the front desk nearly everytime I walked past. The previous year I stayed at Eduard VII near l'Opera and found it much more charming, accomodating, with friendlier reception and service.
