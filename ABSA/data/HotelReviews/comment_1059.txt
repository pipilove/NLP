Great Hotel, Great Location

Great place to stay, perfect location. Eiffel Tower only a 10 minute walk through the beutiful streets in Paris. Metro station only 3 minute walk, so you can go almost anywhere, and still be close to your hotel by metro. The area is extremely safe, and clean. Yes, there was a bit of construction, but nothing bothersome (they were finished by the time we left). The room was small, but to be expected... but who stays in the room anyway? You have all of Paris to explore (bring good walking shoes!). Also recommed the l'open tour bus, takes you all around major tourist sites in Paris, get on and off as you like. They make stops frequently.Breafast was good, croissants, cereal, ham, cheese, coffee, juice.Great Hotel, would definetly stay here again.
