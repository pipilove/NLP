Not the greatest

Stayed here for honeymoon. On first impressions every thing seemed ok....but there were a few problems:LOCATION: Its great for cable car and during the day the area of fisherman's wharf is buzzing with activity, however at night the area is quite seedy.. Hooters is up the street, there are numerous homeless people begging and harrassing passersby (watch out for the one who hides behind a bunch of leaves, and jumps out on people..and gets tips for this), numerous youths drinking and cruising in their vintage cars starting fights with each other. ROOMS: Bit tacky but good fun..Cheetah robes, fishing equipment. Have to agree walls are paper thin, and could hear next door's arguements!SERVICE: Not bad, although porter promised since we were on honeymoon we'd have a bottle of champagne in our room...He then accepted our generous tip, and never materialised with the goods.RESTAURANT: Only went for breakfast, which was again ok. Not much choice. Beware though, we had our bag stolen during breakfast, staff were helpful but we've never heard anything since.FAMILIES: We did over hear a lady at reception claiming she feared for her children in the area, and asked staff was it safe. The hotel wasn't really geared for families esp with the wine evenings in reception....they looked like a bunch of old men and women seeing how much free drink they could get.All in all our stay was ok, we'd go shopping in Union Square, went to Alcatraz day trip and liked to spent as much time away from the hotel. I wouldn't stay in the Argonaut again, nor recommend to my family.
