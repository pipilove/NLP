Accurate reviews

First of all, thanks to all who write reviews for this website. We found the reviews to be very accurate. This hotel definitely deserves its rank.My only trepidation in writing this review is that someday it will be too popular to get a reservation! After comparing its location with my other top choices, I'm glad we choose it. The laws of physics dictate that if it's a busy street and you're above it, noise travels up! at first glance the street did look very quiet, but as we got to know the area we found all we needed. Others have mentioned the various shops for food, etc..so I'll just mention the ATM at the end of the block (left out of the hotel) where you feel very safe. We ate at Le Basilac, one of the restaurants on the sheet that the front desk will give you for asking. It's very close and business was just picking up when we left at 9p.m.We loved the hotel! The staff is gracious, polite and willing to help. The rooms are clean and tastefully decorated and the bathrooms were great. My husband is a pretty good-sized guy and he felt very comfortable with the beds and the bath. The mini-fridge came in handy and we stocked up from the store across the street (and the patiserrie down the street)We ordered a taxi for the airport the day before with the front desk and it arrived right on time.The gentleman that placed the order was kind enough to ask about our luggage and realize we would need to reserve a larger taxi.Oh,just remember that if you order a taxi, the meter starts from their departure point, not your's!We're definitely going to stay here again.t
