Central Location

Not a bad hotel but certainly not worth the 4star rating or 4star prices!!, the rooms are very clean and functional but are very small. The staff are friendly and willing to help. In-room tea and coffee facilities would be a bonus.. The location of this hotel makes it ideal for exploring all of Barcelona.
