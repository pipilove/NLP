Nightmare experience

We had a reservation that we booked online directly through the property. When we got there to check in they said they had been trying to contact us (which I know they hadn't) because they did not have a room for us. When I asked how they lost our reservation, she said they did not lose it but rather they never had a room for us  when they received our reservation they had handed it over to their management dept. to handle, who never once tried to contact us. Funny how we got a confirmation via email but we did not receive the email they supposedly sent to tell us of the situation, nor did we receive any phone calls they claimed to have made. They offered to upgrade us at another sister property so we said ok. They drove us to new property which was further away from where we wanted to be  looked like a dive. When we walked into the office, the man behind the desk did not even look up or speak to us for a couple minutes. He finally said the room was not ready  we could wait next door. This was supposed to be a smoke-free hotel but the manager was in his room (right off the registration area) smoking away in his unmade bed. The complimentary continental breakfast consisted of powered orange juice, coffee, tea, hot cocoa,  danishes that had been sitting out in the smoky office. Needless to say, we did not stay here  found accomodations elsewhere in the city. Bottom line--poor management  customer service. I would not stay here if it was the last place in San Francisco.
