Terrible rooms - stay away

I stayed at the Westin Berlin 3 or 4 times. This time I stayed for two nights and they gave me a room upgrade to a renovated room. Renovated? Yes, they call it renovated. The renovated rooms are located to the courtyard and have the same size like the normal rooms. Bad smell, ugly furniture, bad design, old fahioned, dirty, noisy a/c and not really a heavenly bed I guess. Forget about the rooms in this hotel!Still, the location is the best and the lobby is very pritty and impressive. But the rest of the hotel, forget about it. Also the food at Friedrichs is boring and very traditional. If you have the chance, go for the brand new Radisson, Hyatt, Marriott or Adlon.
