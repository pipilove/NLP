Great location but be prepared for noise!

Just returned from a long weekend at the Hotel Jazz in Barcelona and have a pretty mixed review which i hope will be helpful for those thinking of staying there.The hotel is lovely and clean, the beds and bathrooms are big for a city hotel and staff are friendly and helpful, the rooftop pool is a fab advantage and the views arent bad.However the hotel is in no way soundproofed internally! it is true we couldnt hear any street noise but the sound of the person in the room above showering was enough to wake me up every morning as well as the noise of the lift and staff and guests making their way along corridors which echoed throughout the rooms!Breakfast is a complete waste of time and was worse than anything i have ever tried to eat - definitely worth getting up and going out for it.Other than that it was a pleasant enough stay but would definitely choose somewhere else next time.
