Great for not making your hols feel like a business trip

I thought I might add my voice to the many reporting here...The hotel was great with the foyer and very cool lift setting the mood.The room (64) was clean (apart from the mysterious but inoffensive appearance of an empty wrapper marked Trojan) and had a great view of the Sacre Coeur over the rooftops. The furniture was warm (in feeling, not temperature although that was fine). The staff was helpful and patient with my French. We didn't try the television / look in the minibar since there was no shortage of entertainment or bars even in a very wet and windy December Paris. We didn't try the breakfast either as there's no shortage of cafes to find a coffee and a croissant.Since I travel relatively frequently with business, I find it difficult to drop into holiday (vacation) mode in the sort of identi-room seen in most cities in most countries, and when I'm off for a long weekend with my fiancee we don't need a pool on site, great conference facilities and 2,134 channels of TV to alleviate the boredom of a soulless cell. This place was the perfect antidote.I gather the previous reviewer's successors in room 63 (or 62) also enjoyed their stay from the faintly audible expressions of pleasure (ahem), but other than that and some gently gurgling plumbing, the place was quiet. Obviously the place has a certain mood to it...Hausman is very close so perfect for shoppers, but everywhere is walkable and the metro is less than two minutes away.
