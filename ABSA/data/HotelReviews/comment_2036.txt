High rise version of an extended stay motel in US

Stayed from 14-17 Oct during my second visit to Sydney. It reminds me of an extended stay motel in US except this is a high rise version. I was on the 10th floor with a view of an office building. It is a 5 minute walk from Museum station (Liverpool exit). Turn left when you exit the station. Around the corner there is a small IGA grocery store with the basics, Subway, Hungry Jack's (Burger King), and a few small coffee shops. I did not see any nicer sit down restaurants, and I noticed as many homeless panhandlers as there are in King's Cross.I tried to use my Wyndam rewards number which works with Travelodges in US, but this one would not accept it. They have an Australian program which does me no good as a tourist. There are pay Internet kiosks for a fee in the lobby. There is an Internet Everywhere ($AD 2 per hour) about a 5 minute walk away. Turn right when exiting Museum station (Liverpool exit).The room was very basic. They could do a better job of cleaning the floor and carpet. I noticed long hair on the floor, on the carpet, on the bed spread, and the smell of wet dog was strong on my first few hours in the room.The matress was pretty firm because there was no box spring. The pillow were pretty flat. There is a fridge, microwave, hot water pot, plates, bowls, and utensils in the room.I would only stay here again , but only by myself. Only stayed because of the cheap price, good location, and belief that I could collect Wydham points.
