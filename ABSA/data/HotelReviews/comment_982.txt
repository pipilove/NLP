Don't expect miracles

I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights with my Mum in early October. I had booked a twin room with breakfast via a travel agent. When we arrived the receptionist surprised us saying that they ran out of twin rooms and could offer us only a double room. We were willing to pay for an upgrade but all rooms had been taken. It wasn't a great start. The room was a shoe box size and smelt heavily of cigarette smoke. Luckily, the house-keeping was quick to react and in the evening when we came back, it was all fresh and pleasant. The best part of our double room was the bathroom. It was clean and modern although petit. The reception staff was always very friendly and happily offered advice on how to use public transport and taxis. Breakfast was also sufficient with a reasonable selection of pastries and bread and rolls. The cheese board was OK. We loved the location and proximity to a Metro station, lots of shops (bakery, grocery shop, cheese shop, etc) and more importantly to the Notre Dame. I'm not sure if Agora St Germain hotel was the best value for money. Well, it was a busy period in Paris due to the Rugby Cup so many hotels were fully booked and other put up the prices. Given the overall experience, I will consider another hotel in the area in the future.
