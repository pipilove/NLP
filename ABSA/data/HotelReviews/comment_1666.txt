Overrated and overpriced

We stayed at the W for a few nights in July. While the location was pretty central and the bar scene was fun, we has a few negative experiences that would dissuade me from returning. First, the staff was snooty and unhelpful. Whether it was dinner suggestions or directions, they were of little help and did not want to lift a finger for us. Another major drawback was the service. Other than the fact that the televisions were broken, the room was not serviced by housekeeping on more than one occasion. We had to keep calling housekeeping to get them to clean the room, and when they did, they would not provide new toiletrees or enough towels. Additionally, the bathrooms need a lot of remodeling - it was very old and uninviting. The bar at the hotel is certainly trendy and fun, but I would stay at the Fairmont in the future. Same location, same cost and much, much nicer.
