Ruined our aniversary!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Seattle Sheraton listed as a 4 Star, Beware not even close, maybe a 2 if that. Went to Seattle for our Aniversary. They put us in a small room, with a horrible view. The worst thing was the beds were so small, we had to sleep in seperate beds!!!! The Pool, Spa, And exercise facility's are all closed and will not reopen until October, I think is the month the lady at the front desk said. She was very rude, and said the Hotel had notified Priceline of the facility closures. Our room was not cleaned properly, towels looked like they were thrown on the hooks, dirty glasses not exchanged, beds looked horrible and the pillows were on the floor??? Better bring alot of extra cash. Stayed 2 days parking was 56 bucks. The water in the room is not drinkable, However you can buy there's $$$$. Food in over cooked, at least the water in cafe was drinkable, and don't be fooled by there complimentary newspaper, if you read the sticker the put on it you will see that you will be charged for it to $$$$. Thanks for our ruined Aniversary Seattle Sheraton. Next time We will stay at the Camlin or one of the other real 4 Star hotels in the same area!!!!!!!!
