Horrific Customer Service in a Crisis

Stayed at Du Cadran for three nights in total which were less than adequate! Our room was miniscule, customer service was inconsistent at best - but the icing on the cake was the morning of departure when our mini safe wouldn't open and eventually a 'handy man' came to our room with an angle grinder to retrieve our belongings. During the forty minutes of waiting for our passports and personal items to be rescued I had several extremely unsastisfactory encounters with frontdesk staff who blamed me for my inconvenience! Our belongings were significantly damaged by the workman's attempts to cut the minisafe open which the front desk staff refused to recognise and maintain was not their fault.The morning turned into a horrific fiasco during which not one of the hotel staff took responsibility for what transpired, when we asked to talk to someone in charge we were directed to contact the hotel manager who was conveniently unavailable and who the staff would not contact on our behalf. The whole situation denigrated into a very hostile situation which resulted in our nearly missing our plane.I will never return to this hotel and this experience has marred what should have been an otherwise enjoyable holiday.
