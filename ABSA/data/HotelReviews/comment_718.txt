Great location!

Stayed at the Park Inn for four nights in May with my husband. Would probably say it is a smart 3* rather than 4*, but we had a very pleasant stay there. The bed was especially comfy and no, it isn't weird to have the two separate mattresses and duvets for a double bed, that's what they're all like in Germany! The toilet and shower had one 'shared' door (in fact we didn't work this one out until 30 mins. before we checked out!! Doh! But the 'open plan' style of the room allows little privacy, so probably best you stay there with someone you're at least vaguely intimate with! Fantastic location, you can virtually roll out the front door and straight into the U-Bahn. Alexanderplatz is also a central station on the S-Bahn line and is direct to and from Schæžšnefeld airport.
