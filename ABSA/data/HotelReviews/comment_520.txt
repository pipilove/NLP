Excellent Front of House Team

A group of us stayed here for a friends 40th Birthday in December. Great location, excellent front office team, especially Amanda, great bar. The rooms were on the small side and if I stayed again would book a superior as these were bigger. The lighting in the bedrooms and bathrooms does need improving as not easy to do make up in poor light. Overall we had a great weekend
