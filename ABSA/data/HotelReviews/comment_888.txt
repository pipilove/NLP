Average stay

We were checked in by a rather frosty receptionist to find we'd been given the tiniest of rooms. This was strange as during our whole weekend we hardly saw any other guests - so it was clear they weren't busy/full.The room itself was unacceptably dusty - it looked like it hadn't been occupied for sometime. It was modern although the finance link to everything doesn't really work and ends up looking a bit tacky. Our bathroom featured a shower (no bath) squeezed into such a tiny space it made it difficult to close the door. This caused the bathroom to constantly flood. The sink, while very trendy, had no plug which causes an unnecessary waste of water.The location is OK...fairly close to everything, but it's certainly not with the main sights on your doorstep.Overall, this was an OK stay but the experience could have been a lot better - especially as they had virtually no other guests.
