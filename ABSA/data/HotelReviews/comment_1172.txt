Customer Friendly

We had a lovely stay at the Hotel. Staff were helpful but unobtrusive. The Hotel is very plesant, rooms are a good size and very well kept. The summer offers were excellent value and being able to have breakfast in the Courtyard was a real bonus. Ideal location for all the major sites. We will return and have recommended the Hotel to all our friends
