Excellent Value and position!

I must admit, I did use Trip Advisor to choose the Altamont. It was the best value hotel in the top 15 that I looked at. In fact it was quite a bit cheaper than all the others. So naturally I was a bit concerned. On arrival, I was pleasantly surprised, personally shown to my room by the Manager and it was super quiet with sliding doors looking out to a little inner courtyard.The decor was basic but also it had a trendy style. I never have a bath so the big shower was nice. Comfy bed, table and chairs, drawers with tv on it. It had space for the suitcase so what more could I possibly want? Oh yes I did want a good location, and I got it at the Altamont! Handy for restaurants, just around the corner you can get a bus to Circular Quay or at the bottom of Darlinghurst Road/Oxford St you can get a direct bus (no 333 the bondi Bendy!) to Bondi Beach!For other transport, Kings Cross is 5 mins walk away.It was clean, friendly and because Sydney is my favourite city in the world, I will be back, and to the Altamont!
