Missed this place as they changed policy

Had to cancel our booking at the Argonaut as they changed their policy to being a non-smoking property on the 1st of May and didn't inform us. They are trying to charge a cancellation fee. I would likefor other people considering the Argonaut to know that they are non smoking and their reservations guy was impossible to deal with.
