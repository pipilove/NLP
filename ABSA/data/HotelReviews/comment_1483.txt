We just returned from a fabulous trip to San Francisco and stayed at the Westin St. Francis on Union Square. Pros and cons to this property. . .they bill themselves as a 5 star hotel and yet there were some basic problems with our room/stay that told a different story. We stayed on the 17th floor of the new tower and LOVED the speed and ease of elevator service. However, the room itself was very bland/boring/empty. Peeling wallpaper on one of the walls, tub caulking coming out and the tub itself was not very clean. Very basic amenities in the bathroom also. The air conditioning didn't seem up to the task of keeping the room cool. . .very stuffy the whole time we were there. The ice machine on our floor was broken throughout our stay so we had to take the elevator up or down one floor to get ice. None of this was totally horrible, just a bit disappointing for the price you are paying for this hotel. What you are paying for though is the excellent location in the city. We were hardly in the room because we were exploring the city from this great location on Union Square. One of the highlights of the trip was our breakfasts. . . HIGHLY recommend the Sears Fine Food restaurant, just a block from the hotel on Powell. Long lines move quickly and the Swedish pancakes are worth the wait! Also good is Max's, which is around the corner from the hotel also. NIcer atmosphere. . .excellent omelets. Great restaurant for lunch is Roxanne's Cafe. . .up the hill on Powell. Enjoy San Fran!
