Dude, it was perfect

Stayed there for 4 nights at the end of Sep 04'. It was perfect. There is a tram stop right in front of the place. The location was perfect, tons of restaurants, bars, coffeeshops, etc. around the corner. Not only did you need a room key to get into the hotel, you also needed a room key to use the elevator (great security). The staff was great too. At 4am our mini-bar was empty and the front desk brought up a 12 pack of Heineken upon our request. Red Light District was about 4 blocks away yet the hotel is in a major square that was extremely safe. There is also an ATM machine right outside the door of the hotel. My buddy bought an $800 watch from the jewelry store inside the hotel. The whole place was classy and affordable. Just an FYI - you'll pay more for an Orange Juice than you will a beer in Amsterdam.
