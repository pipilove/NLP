Good Location

Saw some of the bad reviews on Trip adviser, but was pressed for time and Le Walt was one of few with available rooms- so took a chance. Got a superior room, but I think it was really meant for disabled people because the bedroom itself was small but the bathroom very large (for the turning radius of a wheelchair) and it was ground floor. However, it was comfortable and quiet. The breakfast at the Le Walt was very good. The best thing about this place is the location- right off a major metro station and could walk to the Rue Cler district so highly acclaimed by Rick Steves (it is actually pretty nice). I found the staff at the Le Walt very professional and pleasant. It is a boutique hotel and has that feel. A mix of nationalities staying here: American, Brits, Chinese, and yes- even French. Bathrooms are modern as shown in photos. There was one bad point- we found a cockroach in the bathroom one night. And on the second night. However, I think this is something the smaller hotels are constantly battling in any big city at certain points in time: too close to adjacent restaurants and food. Thus I give them 3 points (neutral/average) instead of Above average.
