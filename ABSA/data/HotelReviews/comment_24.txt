Very Elegant

I stayed at the Hotel Pulitzer in the beginning of January. Rooms were european sized but the room was very well kept and very clean. Nice bath amenities. Nice sheets and linen.Room Service Food was good. Staff was very helpful. Pulitizer is right on the Pritzgracht canal and has an excellent location. It is quiet and safe in a residential area. On thing I liked was just a block away was an Albert Heijn grocery store for picking up an odd room snack or soda so you don't have to pay $5.00 from the mini bar. The tram stopped here as well, making it easy to get around town
