Exceptionally enjoyable!!

We booked onto the 'Surprisingly Different package, and were extremely pleased with the level of service throughout our stay. They even left a small birthday gift and card in the room for a member of our party, even though we hadn't booked the 'birthday' promotion.The staff were friendly and helpful and we enjoyed our nights in the Anhalter Bar sampling the varieties of beers and the odd cocktail. The choice at breakfast was varied and set us up for a full day of sightseeing around the city and our meal in the restaurant one evening was wonderful, particularly as we were able to request a change to the set menu without much trouble as one of our party didn't eat meat.The rooms were cleaned to a high standard, as were all areas of the hotel. Location wise, you can easily walk to some of the main attractions with ease and if not, there are buses and the S-Bahn nearby.Overall, we were more than 'surprised' and would certainly visit again.
