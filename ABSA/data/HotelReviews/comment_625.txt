rooms are simply awful!

I stayed at the Grand Westin several times. If you get a deluxe room (yes, you are right: deluxe room) you will hate this hotel. Lobby and location is perfect. Service is so so. I'm a Starwood Platinum Member and they didn't upgrade me! They said it was a congress like Berlinale or so. The rooms are so old fashioned, stinky and noisy. Bathrooms are even worse. Dont go for the pictures on the starwood internet site. In reality, rooms look different! (and much worse!!)
