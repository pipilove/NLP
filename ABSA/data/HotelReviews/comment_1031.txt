An OK Hotel

The Splendid Etoile Hotel is a nice average French hotel which is a little dated. This adds to the charm for a romantic getaway in Paris. However, for the business traveler, it is a bit of a challenge. Taxis are impossible to get, travel arrangements cannot be made through the hotel, and the checkout time is 12 noon without the possiblity to extend it. So while I liked the hotel, its services fell short of meeting the needs of the modern business traveller. I would recommend it for a romantic getaway.
