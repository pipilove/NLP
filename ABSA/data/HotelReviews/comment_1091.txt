I agree!

My family of 4 stayed at the Hotel Langlois for four nights. At first, I wasn't so sure about the neighborhood and being far from sites. But we weren't at all. We walked to everything, but took the subway back. The folks who work at the Langlois were very nice. We stayed in a suite that accomodated us well, but for the last night needed two seperate rooms since I made a mistake when I reserved. They did give us two rooms, moved our luggage for us, and gave us a very much coveted air-conditioned room! When I checked out and paid for our stay, I realized that they only charged us for the suite again for the last night! That saved a bit of money. I doubt that there is a better deal in Paris. In the neighborhood we picked up outstanding coissants for 1 euro. Breakfast for 1 euro? My children voted their stay in Paris the best of our 2 week adventure.
