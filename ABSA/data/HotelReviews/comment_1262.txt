Fantastic base for exploring San Francisco

My wife and I stayed in ten hotels during a two-week trip around California, Nevada and Arizona and the Castle Inn gave the best value for money. Ideally placed for exploring San Francisco, the staff were really friendly and helpful, making us feel very welcome after a lengthy drive. The room was clean and comfortable and we thought the breakfast was good-especially when compared with most of the others we experienced. Of course the parking was a great advantage-we parked up and never thought about the car for the duration of our stay. We could hear traffic, but what do you expect in a city?!All in all, we can highly recommend the Castle Inn.
