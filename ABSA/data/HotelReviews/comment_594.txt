A negative part of our trip

I just looked up this hotel, suprised to still see it is #3 in Barcelona. I have been meaning to write a review on this hotel because of the fact that staying here made me dislike Barcelona (hotels really can affect your overall view of a place, unfortunately). I usually trust trip advisor, and I did when I booked this hotel. The hotel rooms are nice, the roof deck/pool is great, and the hotel is beautiful. It is also in a great location. The problem with the hotel is the staff. The staff on our initial 2 days there were horrible, unhelpful, and never smiled (particularly the front desk staff). On our final day there, after much complaining, we managed to find some helpful staff and wished they had been that nice the entire time. A great hotel should never have mean, unfriendly, and unhelpful staff. The best part of our trip was when we actually left the hotel and stayed elsewhere!
