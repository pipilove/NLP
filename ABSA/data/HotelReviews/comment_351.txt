Utter luxury!!!!!

Stayed for a couple of nights in April and i have to admit this is probably the most comfortable hotel i have ever stayed in.If you can, go for the Club Class rooms, truly amazing size with the the best bathroom/ shower room i have experienced.Club class gives you access to your own lounge with food  drink etc - Very comfortable.Great service and food for the late night snack i had in the 1st floor restaurant.Also excellent service from the bar staff who served us drinks in the garden area beside the swimming pool.Its the Arts every time for me!!!
