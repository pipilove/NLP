Great Service, Great Price, Great Hotel

This hotel was a great experience for us. We stayed in San Francisco for 5 nights. The hotel is right next to Union square and the cable cars - not a problem with noise. My fiance and I slept prefectly throughout the night. The bath tubs are huge and perfect for a relaxing bath after a long day. The front desk staff and bellmen were fantastic with directions and places to go, along with restaurant recommendations. There is free coffee and cookies, which were both delicious. This was a great hotel at an extremely affordable price when booked on expedia. I recommend this hotel to everyone!!!
