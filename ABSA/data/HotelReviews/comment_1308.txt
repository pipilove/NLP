Efficient but not great value

We stayed at this hotel at the end of a trip travelling around California. When we started our trip we stayed at the excellent Donatello, but unfortunately they had no rooms available when we returned to the city. The Omni was expensive and although it did everything it is meant to do it did it without any soul. We booked through Priceline a room with two double beds. On arrival Reception said that as this was booked through a third party it could not be guaranteed and so we had to have a bed made up for our daughter. I have no criticisms of the room, apart perhaps that everything being a bit too frilly - not really our style. I was irritated to have to pay $10 for access to the hotel wifi - why do the cheaper hotels and motels provide this free and the more expensive hotels charge for this?The breakfast was over formal and as their is no buffet we ordered dishes that were OK, but extremely over priced. The staff were efficient and the doorman friendly, but I would not stay at this hotel again.
