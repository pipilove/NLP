Lousy Service!!!

We stayed there for a week. the rooms and housekeeping is ok. except that they do nor provide the basic toothbrush. though complementary, we need to call for housekeeping to get them...rooms are ok.comfy.first day when we checked in, we double confirmed with our breakfast for the week. the recept said yes, we had breakfast..all was well, when the next morning, we came down for breakfast, and we were told that our breakfast is not included in the rooms.. we gave them all references and they confirmed that no breakfast included.we were disappointed, confirmed with our agent the next day, and realised that the recept got it wrong. so the first day wasted for us. this is not the worst, no apologies.. nvm.about the internet, it is chargeable at A$0.55 per min, and a max of A$27.50 per dayso we double confirmed with the recept that max A$27.50 per day she said yes, and we only have got one point.so guess wat, we were billed double.cause me n my friend have got 2 diff laptops and this was not even stated that it is based on per computer.and when the bill arrives, the recept was rude and kept saying that... too bad... u never read... hahaworst week there!!!amenities are good, only that the service staff there sucks... beware!!SingaporePPs
