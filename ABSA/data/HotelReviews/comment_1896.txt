Big bed, tiny room in this soul-less, ex Japanese owned hotel

View from the room was great though.Room was noisy. Ok if you are a heavy sleeper, don't mind hearing the people next door take a shower, run a bath or listen to guests in the corridor etc. I suppose..Not very close to major public transport - Ok if you don't mind walking, solely using the limited  expensive, touristy monorail or have little luggage or like using taxis. But then, it IS Darling harbour after all!Staff were, how can I put it, without wanting to use an insulting word or being impolite? The term 'surly', feels apt.Despite pre-paying 100% of the non-refundable rate including ALL taxes on the hotel's own website, months before arriving, they tried to sting me when I checked out. I was told that they had made a 'mistake' on the hotel rate  I needed to pay the difference... So be careful! Apparently, according to the receptionist I spoke to, it happens a lot. What seems like a good rate may not be if the hotel receptionists try and wangle more money out of you just as you are leaving. No mention was made of course when I checked-in of their 'mistake'. After a discussion with a manager, I was eventually advised that I would not have to pay for THEIR mistake. The breakfast room (which is actually in the lobby of the hotel) was chaotic with really long queues  over-priced. Better choice  more relaxing to eat at a nearby cafe. So, this was my first ( last) stay at a Four Points Hotel. Maybe I was just unlucky, but I wouldn't stay there again. There are plenty of other places to stay!
