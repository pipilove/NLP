Super and Sullen

The arrival in a taxi from the station was a non event. Struggling with our suitcases the doorman did not make any attempt to help us and one of us is seriously disabled. In fact nobody made any attempt to help us. Made us feel a but queasy about this place. right from the start...Not particularly welcoming staff at the desk. All very strange for a 4 star &quot;hip&quot; hotel.!Room was superbly smallish and narrow..ish, however, except for some minor(major to us as it was a room especially for &quot;disabled&quot; ?people) details it really was good accomodation . BUT..although the shower was excellent it was so dark you couldn't see the soap! NO facial tissues available at all....and most importantly the only socket in the bathroom is very far away from the sink for shavers, toothbrushes etc.... And imagine no socket for the laptop on the fold down desk!... I had to ask for an extension cord to be able to use a socket clear across the room. The bed ,though,was exceptionally comfortable as were the choice of pillows.Most annoying of all was the sullen staff everywhere (one exception: the excellent bartender) and most especially the unpleasant staff in the restaurant. Even when our wallet was stolen the front desk couldn't have cared less and helped even less than that. Checking out from hotel was incompetent as the cashier tried the old/new trick of trying to charge in our local currency instead of Euro....and then when he had to reverse the transaction he managed to block that amount off our credit line for 9 days after! A struggle as we had lost our principal credit cards and were living on a debit card off of an obscure account of ours!I would never return to the Pulitzer only because of the staff....the hotel is perhaps passable for just the atmosphere of the place itself and the rooms but the staff....phooey!
