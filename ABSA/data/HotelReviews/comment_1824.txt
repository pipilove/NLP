An awful stay

Stayed here for 4 nights. This would be the worst place I have stayed, staff were totally imcopetent and rude and when we finally got food it was not fit for human consumption. Everything was blamed on alterations taking place, even the fact that drinks could not be supplied. Rooms were not clean and smelt musty. Looked like there had been a flood in our room. Backpackers lodge would be better and you would be treated better. Staff up to management level were not interested in complaints either.
