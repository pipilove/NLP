Very business oriented

We stayed here over the new year's break and although it was very clean, comfortable and centrally located, we felt that it was very business oriented (even though everyone who stayed there were probably on holiday during that period of time). it was very centrally located though, and that was very useful for us as tourists. The price was ok for the peak period - however if I had to do it again, I'd probably start booking for a hotel much earlier and chosen a different hotel.
