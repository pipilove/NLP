A truly awful reservations experience

I use TripAdvisor.com regularly so when I saw that the Radisson SAS Berlin had been rated the number one hotel in the city I was confident I would be in for something special.Instead I was in for 8 international calls to the hotel and the central reservations number because the people I dealt with firstly reserved me rooms on incorrect dates and secondly failed to send me any kind of confirmation.I've now resolved the issue and am just hoping that my actual stay will prove less stressful than the reservations process. Based on the evidence so far, this will be a triumph of hope over experience.
