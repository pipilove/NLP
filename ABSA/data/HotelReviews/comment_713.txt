I had a wonderful stay

the hotel is near Alexander Platz, there is a bus stop just in front of the hotel which allows you to easily reach Alxender Platz if you r not in the mood to walk 5 minutes... from Alexander Platz u can take all kind of public transports that will allow u to reach all the parts of the city. The rooms were big enough, clean and very confortable, the people who work there are friendly. breakfast was very good. I really advice the hotel
