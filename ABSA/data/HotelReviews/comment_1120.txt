Terrible Stay at Hotel Foch

My husband and I stayed in Hotel Foch for three nights this January, 2008. The location of the hotel was about a mile from the Metro, with not a lot of restaurants or cafe's nearby. The room was very small, with just enough room to get in the bed on each side. We had originally picked the hotel because of the reasonable price, and positive reviews but again and again we were disappointed. The first night we realized we could hear every sound outside of our door, and coincedentally they happened to be doing construction in the very next room. Electric drills, hammers, the works. We asked to change rooms but there was nothing available, but we were assured the construction would stop soon. Around 7PM it ended. We went to take a shower, and to our dismay there was NO hot water. Not only that the shower head was bursting bouts of dirt all over the bathtub. We were very disappointed at this point to the point of wanting to check out and when we expressed our concerns the plumber of the hotel came up to our room and started SCREAMING at my husband saying my husband did not know what hot water was (because there isn't a difference between freezing and warm in his mind apparently). We ended up staying at the hotel because we had already paid and were given attitude for the rest of our stay. Also, we found out that the hot water heater had broken the night before from the receptionist. Instead of being honest about their problem, they lied straight to our faces and tried to deny any problem at all. We would never stay at hotel Foch again, or suggest it to anyone we know.
