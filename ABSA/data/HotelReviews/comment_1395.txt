DIsappointed in Front Desk Staff and Room Size

We were anticipating a special stay for our anniversary trip.The front desk staff couldn't even be bothered to greet us hello. She took our confirmation information and was annoyed that we didn't have an additional copy to give her. The room was clean and nicely decorated but very small. The view from our 4th floor window was of two outside building walls, but it was very quiet. My husband talked with the concierge, who he found very helpful. The daily coffee and newspaper in the lobby were nice to have in the early morning. The location is great, only a few blocks from the Wharf. When we checked-out, the front desk clerk didn't even bother to ask about our stay, which is very unusual. Fortunately, the hotel we stayed at in Monteray more than made up for our disappointing experience at this hotel.
