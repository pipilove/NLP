Don't trust them for Events or anything remotely complex

My family were staying at the Argoanut for my wedding. I'd heard great things about Klimpton Hotels, but something went terribly awry. The reservations were completely screwed up. They tried to give us rooms, that were already reservered by others, and did not tell me till I called a month before the wedding to reconfirm. I left mulitple messages and NO ONE would call me back. Meanwhile my family is wondering if they should cancel their travel plans to come to my wedding. Out of desparation I called a manager three weeks before the wedding, in tears, because I had not idea if my family had rooms, despite that I blocked off 7 months beforehand. Although the manager found us rooms, but the real disaster is when they charged the wrong cards for the rooms, that was was horribly embarrassing. My whole family was mad and yes, the Argonaut made me get in the middle of it to straiten it out. I was late to my own reception dinner, because they said they'd have the car ready in 15 minutes, and it took them 45. I think it was because the curbside staff was so busy chatting up the girls walking up and down the street, they forgot to do thier job. The place is nice, and the prices are great - but don't count on them for anything important.Relying on the Argonaut was by far the most stressful and horrible aspect of my wedding. They really ruined the experience for me. Every time I think about my special day, I cringe, and the Argonaut debacle is the first thing to come to mind, eventhough I try really hard to forget it and move on. Don't make the same mistake I did.
