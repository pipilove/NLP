Solid Business Hotel-Not 4 Star

I stayed at the Mercure for business and was very pleasantly surprised by my stay. My room as unusually large by European standards. The bathroom and the shower room were separate, quite convenient when sharing the room with someone. And I was pleasantly surprise in the morning to find that the towel warmer also triggered some sort of floor warmer which kept my toes nice and toasty come the morning.With this said, I would not qualify the standards as four star. I think it's an exceptiona 3-star, but as a 4 star it's merely average at best. If you are looking for value and location, look not further, but don't expect luxury.
