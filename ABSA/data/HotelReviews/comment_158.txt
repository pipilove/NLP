Enjoyable stay

After seeing so many bad reviews on here, we were dreading staying at the Victoria. But I have to say we didn't come across any of the problems like dirty cramped rooms, rough towels, poor service. The only complaint I have is that when we arrived around 10am, I asked if they would look after our luggage until we could check in. I was told there was no such facility, so we had to wait a few hours in the bar next door with our bags. When we came to check out, we saw the porter storing bags, and asked if we could do the same, he said checking in or checking out so the facility was there all along. Apart from that we had an excellent stay in a superior room in a hotel very centrally located. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.
