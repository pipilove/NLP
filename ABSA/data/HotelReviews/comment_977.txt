Quiet and well positioned

A well positioned hotel near to the Maubert Metro stop and only a short distance from the centre of town. Like many hotels in Paris the rooms are on the small side but perfectly adequate. The whole hotel was scrupulously clean and the beds very comfortable. An excellent night's sleep could be had since the hotel is located on a very quiet side-street. Breakfast at 11 euros was a good buy with plenty of drinks available and an adequate range of cold items, although you could have items cooked for an additional cost. We stayed for four nights and have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anybody.
