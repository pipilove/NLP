The best in Amsterdam!

The hotel itself lies along a grand canal in a beautiful and historic Amsterdam neighborhood. Everything about it is five stars...service, elegant and comfortable rooms, food, etc, etc...My husband and I went for a romantic weekend and are already getting ready to book again for the holiday season! Perfection!
