Quiet, comfortable beds, no views, free parking

Got a cheap rate online of $189 for two queens and free parking which in San Fran can run you up to $50 a night. Nice beds, good linens, dated but quiet, great location. Nice bar two blocks east, great breakfast one block west on Van Ness where you pay for a great egg/bacon sandwhich. Hotel breakfast was coffee, muffins and fruit (again free, so it's worth it if you have kids). If you just want a nice bed to sleep in, great location and two blocks from cable car, go for it. Otherwise, no view, no frills place. But the free parking and in/out privileges make it worth it! Nice folks run the place, too.
