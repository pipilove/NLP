Trip to Berlin

We had a small trip to Berlin this spring and choosed this hotel because it is easy to reach and in the heart of berlin. Breakfast is one of the best I ever had, but you have to wait quite a long time to get seated in this small and crowded breakfast room. As this is a quite large luxury hotel, the rooms are really small. The room we got was nothing special, small, clean, thats it. Overall the hotel is quite ok, but I had better ones.
