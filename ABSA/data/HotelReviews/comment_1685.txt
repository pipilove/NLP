Great Place to Stay

My wife and just drove in from Portland and stayed at the Hotel Max. From the moment we arrived, we were greated with friendly, professional assistance. The rooms were small. But very comfortable and clean. The location was perfect to walk to the Pike Street Market. Also good place to walk to the popular resturants in Seattle. Would definitly stay there again and would definitly recommend it to a friend.
