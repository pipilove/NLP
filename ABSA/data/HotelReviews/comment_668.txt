A great deal and nice area

For 88 euros a night (double room), this hotel is an excellent value. The lobby isn't very impressive, and we were a bit worried as we headed up to our room, but it was fairly modern, clean and had a nice view down to the road. I had read that the street was a bit noisy, but we found it to be very quiet actually. Slept VERY well. This hotel is also dog-friendly, though there aren't any parks very close by. Secure parking is available in the garage next door for 11 euros a day. Overall, we were very pleased with our pick and would definitely stay there again.
