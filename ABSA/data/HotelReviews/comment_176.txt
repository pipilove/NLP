good standards

I've stayed in the Victoria Hotel in Augus 06.The location of the Victoria hotel is excellent, opposite of the Central station.Check-in is ok, altough the service and kindness of the front-office staff varies every day.The rooms are ok, equipt with a large bed and comfortable seating, a large desk and sufficient lightening.The bathroom is average, not bad but certainly not superb. Biggest minor is the view of some rooms, ( if you can call it a view ), I was looking at another building at about 2 meters away, so my view was only a wall. It reminded me at a commercial where a couple in a hotel opens a curtain and only spots a wall.........Overall; average experience, pricing is high but location makes up for much.
