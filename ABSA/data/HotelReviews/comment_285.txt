Average hotel.

My wife and I stayed at this hotel in april 2007. We got an standard double room, and stayed there for 4 nights. It is an average hotel: 1. the location is not bad (just opposite to Van Gogh's museum, well-served by tram's lines, and about 15-20 minutes from Centraal Station by tram); 2. the staff is fine; 3. the breakfeast is okay; 4. the room was fairly clean.Overall, an average stay. Neverthless, this is not a hotel for people that like to party: breakfeast is quite early from 7h30 to 9h30, and just around 9h30 they are knocking on your door to see if they can clean your room. On the good side you have free internet access (computer next to breakfeast room); free calls anywhere in the world (that is actually the highlight of the hotel in my opinion); and free laundry. I think we'd stay there again.
