Hotel Max pretends to be hip at the expense of safety and comfort. The rooms are so small a young person feels closed in and the elevators are so small that we felt claustrophobic. At one point, they stopped working and we were trapped. Staffwas not helpful. Service workers were seen using guest elevators, and on and on and on... Get the picture? Plus, the beds were not comfortable. Go over to the Vintage Park.
