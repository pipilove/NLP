Loved this hotel

Very Modern Hotel opposite the train station. Stayed in the Park Inn in August 2004 and it was fantastic, Fabulous room, a little small .Rooms had been recently renovated to a very high standard, spotlessly clean, towels changed every day. Breakfast is hot and cold buffet. The buffet breakfast has to been seen to be believed, two years later my partner is still taking about it. Staff were extremely friendly and spoke excellent English. Fabulous hotel, very highly recommended. Front entrance right beside Tram stop and back entrance right beside U Bahn station. Bus stops less than five minutes walk across the square, Great location to explore Berlin.
