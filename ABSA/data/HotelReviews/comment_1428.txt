Loved it!!

I absolutely loved this hotel. I was a bit concerned about the posts regarding the homeless but there are homeless throughout the city.I stayed in a suite on the 30th floor with absolutely wonderful views of the city. In addition, I had acess to the club upstairs for breakfast and desserts served after 7:30 PM. Just a wonderful experience. The staff was also very very nice.
