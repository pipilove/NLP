After reading the reviews on trip advisor i was looking forward to staying at this hotel. On arrival the hotel was easy to find, just 3 mins walk to the tube station. Very efficient staff at reception, gave us the key to our room. The room was very small but very clean. It stated all room had mini bars but we did not, we had room 106 and appeared fine, however we were over the courtyard (the back of the hotel) early hours of the morning we were woken every night by screaming drunk students who rolled in after a night out. This hotel is a non smoking hotel and eveyone wishing to smoke uses the courtyard right outside our bedroom window. The hotel was full of students and school trips, one night we had to unpolug the phone as we were getting hoax calls all through the night. The room is also next to the stair well so that was constanly banging on our wall. My friend and I are both in our mid twenties and like a drink but the students were very annoying and put me off of writing a good review.Maybe it wasw partly our fault as we could have asked to change rooms however we were only there for 3 nights. Good location and very good breakfast buffet, but wouldnt reccommend unless you are a deep sleeper. REccommend a trip to the concerntration cam to sashenhausen!
