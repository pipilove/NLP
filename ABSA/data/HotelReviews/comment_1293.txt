Excellent Hotel!

We stayed here with our fourteen year-old granddaughter for five nights in early July. We had a king suite that was ideal for us since we all had our own space. The entire hotel staff was attentive including the desk people heating a Hot Pocket for our granddaughter each morning in the employee lounge. (I would suggest a microwave in the room or at least one in public space.)The hotel was clean as a pin, quiet (9th floor), well located and fully met our expectations. We would definitely stay again.
