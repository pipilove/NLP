Nowhere near 5 stars

Stayed for one night and that was more than enough. The shower was cold and the hydrobath didn't work. The breakfast from room service that was charged at 93 EUROS!!!!! was cold and had to be sent back. There was a nightclub under our room which played music that got louder as the night went on and didn't end until after 4am. The night staff's response was to ask us if we wanted to move rooms when I complained at 1.30am and told us not to worry it would be over by 3am.Worst of all was the complete lack of interest when we complained to the staff. The hotel might look impressive but the management and staff are obviously lacking the knowledge, experience and frankly the effort to make this a 5 star experience for their guests.
