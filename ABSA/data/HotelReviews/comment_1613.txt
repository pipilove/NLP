Not bad

The location is excellent, can walk to everything. Our room faced the street, and traffic noise was quite loud even with windows closed, in summer with window's open noise would be bad (don't believe they have air conditioning). Restaurant smells (onions?) were very stong in lobby and elevator - but didn't make it into the room. Shag carpet stuff on headboards a bit weird and not sure how they would clean it. Room large and well appointed otherwise.
