I was a special guest

From the moment I checked in, I was made to feel like a special guest even though I had acquired an online rate that was better than most chain hotels. The front desk staff were friendly, the room service staff efficient, even pouring my coffee before leaving. The rooms were large and luxurious, with a nice big shower AND tub. Having Starbuck's practically in the hotel was nice, and the area is near lots of shopping and a Cheesecake Factory! Right down to the doorman fetching me a taxi on my departure, I was a VIP in every way. Would definitely stay here again.
