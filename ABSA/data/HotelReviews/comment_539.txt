Loved it

We stayed at the Jazz hotel for 3 nights at the start of October. The staff were very friendly and all spoke excellent English. We were staying with our 1 year old and they couldn't have been more helpful. We had a lovely big room, beautifully decorated. The pool was a really lovely place to relax by at the end of the day. The hotel is also excellently positioned just by the top of La Rambla. We had a fantastic time and I would recommend it to anyone.
