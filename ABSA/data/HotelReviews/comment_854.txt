Ultra hard beds.

The beds are solid boards with very firm mattresses. It was like sleeping on a concrete floor. The receptionist called them the French beds (Accor group is French). We hardly slept during our 5 night stay and had aching backs. This is a shame as everything else about Suitehotel is great. The spacious well-designed rooms, the bathroom, the staff, the value, the coffee, the whole concept, are all excellent and we were immediate converts until we went to bed. But lack of sleep can ruin a holiday so we won't be staying in a Suitehotel again, in spite of all the advantages.
