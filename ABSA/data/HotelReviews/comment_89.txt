2 star hotel at most!

first night experience: an extra small room with an awful smell coming from the bathroom ( almost vomited...)breakfast: descentreception: willing but insufficientand as a cherry to the cake: they tried to charge 350 euros for a phone call that never took place. when i denied it they implied i was a liar... what a wonderful attitude! beware...
