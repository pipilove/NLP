ok hotel not so ok staff

My mother and I stayed at the Warwick for 2 nights in November. The hotel itself was ok, fairly clean and decent location.The front desk staff, however are not helpful and pass the buck so as not to have to deal with a problem. If they are working on improving customer service , as previous reviews have stated, they have a ways to go.
