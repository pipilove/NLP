Fantastic staff - perfect base to stay in Berlin!

This was my first time staying in Berlin so I was fairly uncertain about which hotel to pick. After reading reviews on Trip Advisor I picked the Mercure Hotel Checkpoint Charlie as everyone had something good to say about this hotel. The staff was immediately helpful as I sent some emails with some questions which were promptly answered.When we arrived we were immediately impressed by the efficiency of the staff. They also always seem to have a smile on their face all the time which is something we really appreciated.The room we were allocated was really large, extremely clean and very comfortable. I liked the fact that the shower and the toilet facilities were separate to each other. The breakfast was absolutely fantastic and the spread on offer really great! Unfortunately I fell ill with a bad cold and temperature on the last day and the staff did everything they could to try help me out. We paid for a late check out as we had a late flight back and they let us keep the room as long as possible as they were completely booked up.We were lucky enough to meet the Manager of the hotel and have a chat with him. He obviously takes great pride in his hotel and his staff and is a certainly doing a great job...When I got back home I sent an email to the hotel thanking them for our great stay and was more than surprised when I got a phone call back from the hotel thanking us for our email. I have to say this is a first.. I was really impressed by this and would certainly reccomend this hotel to anyone planning a trip to Berlin.Well done to all the staff... keep up the good work and keep smiling!! We will be back on our first trip to Berlin!
