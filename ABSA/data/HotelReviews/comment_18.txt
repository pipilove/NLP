A Very Pleasant Stay

My family and I had a nice and trouble free 4 night stay at the Pulitzer. We found the service generally warm and friendly and the atmosphere casual and relaxed. We had booked an Executive Double and were a bit disappointed to learn at check-in that they would not upgrade our room. My husband and I are BOTH Starwood Gold members, and had been told when we made our reservation that we would be upgraded to a suite if one was available. Alas, the European Starwood properties seem to run their preferred guest program very differently than here in the US, and we didn't get our upgrade....Rooms Nice Enough But no matter. Our Executive Double on the 3rd floor, though small by US standards, had large windows overlooking the center garden and was nice and quiet. The bathroom, though tiny, was well equipped and luxurious. The only real disappointment was a rather lumpy mattress....Family-Friendly As a couple with a young child (toddler) in tow, we appreciated the ample and uncrowded public spaces more than the room itself. There are several interconnected outdoor spaces as well as a few indoor sitting areas, all of which felt casual and welcoming....Food The food was expensive but reasonably good. We had breakfast at Pulitzer's every day during our stay and found the service pleasant and efficient. We broke down and ordered room service one night upon a particularly late return home from sightseeing. The service was quick and the food was tasty.Bottom Line: Refined, yet casual atmosphere with great service and nice location. I would recommend the Pulitzer to others and would stay there again myself.
