Not bad

Stayed here for three nights on our first stop of a 10 day Germany tour. Berlin was more of a tourist attraction for native Germans, sort of like what Washington, DC would be for Americans. Could see most of what you would want to see in about 2 days. Nice, clean and recently renovated hotel. Rooms were very spacious and modern. We got a separate room for our two boys age 19 and 11 but they could have easily stayed in our room with an extra cot. Location was fair. A little bit of a hike to the center of attractions near the government buildings and museums. Public transportation system, however, is outstanding and very easy to use. Couple of nice coffee shops in area so don't waste your euros on hotel breakfast, way to expensive. Staff helpful except for one person who I think had difficulty with the English language.
