Fab location-hotel just ok

Stayed here for 3 nights after getting an excellent deal on expedia.Stay 3 nights pay for 2 so we opted for the Jamison Club Suite.Check in staff were very good, offering us maps and advice on getting around Sydney. Concierge were also helpful with directions etc....Yes, the location is fantastic-especially for first timers like ourselves to Sydney.BUT.....i fail to see what is SO special about this hotel. I am not ultra picky but it struck me as just being 'ok'. I have fortunately stayed in a variety of hotels and this is definately a standard 4 star establishment. Our room did have great views (except the bedroom which looked straight into offices), the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was a decent size.However the room was dusty (i promise I am not being picky! the dust was plain to see) I just dont think it has been used for a while! Room service was prompt but the food utterly vile-I could not even touch the potato and spinach cakes which arrived the size of large sausages, dripping in grease and smelling distinctly of fish-very strange......I hate to complain as this hotel serves it's purpose as a nice hotel in a great location but please dont arrive like me with high expections-you will be disappointed when it fails to deliver anything 'special'.I just dont think this hotel warrants an 'excellent' rating. Location maybe but thats all.To finish on a positive note we loved Sydney. The BridgeClimb was worth every penny, The Rocks had some fab galleries and the Botanical Gardens are a must!I
