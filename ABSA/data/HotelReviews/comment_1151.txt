Enjoyed this hotel!

We are just back from staying at this hotel for three nights. We really enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Elysees Regencia. The hotel is tastefully decorated and has very modern decor. The rooms are small but have everything you need and are impecably decorated. The rooms are very clean and well stocked with towels, toiletries, slippers and bathrobes. Upon arrival the staff were very welcoming and spoke very good english. They were very helpful throughout our stay offering advice and even providing print out maps with directions. The breakfast was lovely- however we felt perhaps a bit pricey at â‚¬18 per head. Having said that- we would highly recommend staying at this hotel- clean, modern, great location and wonderful staff.
