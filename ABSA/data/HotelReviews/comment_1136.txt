Good first visit to Paris

I chose the Hotel Residence Monge for our May trip to Paris based on TripAdvisor reviews. I would recommend the Monge because it was conveniently located (near Notre Dam, the Sorbonne, the Pantheon), affordable, and walking distance to train stops (1/2 a block  2 blocks). As other reviewers have said, Julie was an incredibly efficient manager and was quick to respond in English to email inquiries, and provided excellent dining recommendations and traveling suggestions while we were there. The property itself is not particularly memorable - but the convenience, security, and ease of staying here was perfect for a first time Paris visitor. The proximity to Notre Dam was the best part - we went there a number of times and even purchased tickets for an organ recital (although Sunday Mass was pretty much the same experience and highly recommended).
