Excellent location, modern hotel

We stayed at the Renaissance Paris Vendome for 2 nights, June 10-12 2007. The hotel is in a perfect location, within easy walking distance to all the great shopping near the place vendome, Louvre, tour buses. We had a prestige, non-smoking room with a king bed. It was small - which I had expected from the previous reviews but was still surprised. We could barely walk around our bed. Also - the toilet was near the door entrance while the sink and shower were on the opposite side of the room- also a bit odd, but worked out okay, I picked the hotel b/c I like modern - and it was very clean and modern. Everyone at the hotel was very friendly and accomodating. Also had high speed internet access which was a must. The breakfast was included in our price (490 euro/night) and was excellent- fresh breads, fresh cut fruits, cheese, meat and they cooked eggs to order. They had USA today and other newspapers delivered each day, the hotel was very quiet. Overall, an excellent hotel which I would stay at again.
