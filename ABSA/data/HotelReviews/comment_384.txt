Good but not 4 star

I have just returned form the Hotel Royal after a trip with my mum. I stayed here 3 years ago with my husband and son and was dissapointed that our room was not over looking the Ramblas, as it was last time. The room was small, overlooking a wall, it was v dark and you could only see what the weather was doing outside by opening the window and literally sticking your head out!! There were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room which should really be standard in a 4 Star hotel. The shower was not very powerful, however the bathroom was spotless as was the bedroom. The room was nice and quiet at night for sleeping. Staff were very pleasant. The best thing about the hotel is the location. We didnt use the resaturant for breakfast - we used the cafe across the street (Moko) which was €2.80 for coffee and toast, lovely sitting outside eating breakfast watching all the traders getting set up the day. Hotel is also brilliantly placed to get the airport bus, it stops at Placa Catalyuna (beside El Cortes Ingles), it only costs €4.10 one way and was v quick - 20 minutes and goes every 20 minutes. All in all its a good hotel but definately not a 4 Star by UK / USA standards, however if its only a clean, safe, quiet hotel in a great location then its ideal.
