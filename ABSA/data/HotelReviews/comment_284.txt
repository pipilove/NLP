no so good... Cold and noisy

We stayed in a busineess room for 3 nights, the room was clean and confortable but 27 meters...? Besides the heating was very low, and sometimes we were really cold, overcoat in the batroom...But the worst thing, it was the horrible noise, every mornings our up neighbours waked us up. The noise was so high that it seems that the ceiling was going to fall down. It was not their fault, beacuse in this hotel there is not soundproofing...!!! and in our oppinion in a 3 start hotel it should be fixed.Staff is really nice and helpful, and breakfast very good.
