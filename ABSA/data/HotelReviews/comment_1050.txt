Our Paris Home Away From Home

We recently spent 8 nights at this wonderful hotel. After the first night we instantly felt at home in this place. The room was large, comfortable and clean. The bathroom was clean, well-lit, and the largest we've ever had in Europe. The kitchenette was a nice feature, since we were able to prepare some light meals. The refrigerator was great in keeping some fresh fruits and snacks. And the room was very quiet; we heard very little street noise.The hotel location was very convenient. It is in between two Metro stops, either of which only takes a couple of minutes walk to reach. There is a fresh food market at the Maubert-Mutualit√© Metro stop three times a week. There are many local shops nearby that sell bread (Eric Kayser is our recommendation), pastries, cheese, fruits, etc. If you prefer convenient food there is a Franprix store around the corner.We loved the small size of the hotel. However, the night desk clerk seems to be the only staff available between 7:00 PM and 7:00 AM. One night at 10:00 PM a fuse blew in our room causing half the room and the bathroom to be dark. This did not affect power to the kitchenette, TV and the desk lamp. We called to the front desk and they were unable to help. The next morning at 7:30 AM I went down to the front desk to mention our problem. It was immediately fixed to our satisfaction.We have no doubt that the next time we are in Paris we are going to stay here - if rooms are available.
