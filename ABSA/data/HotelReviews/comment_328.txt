Wonderful Hotel!

After reviewing several 4-5* hotels in different areas of Barcelona, I'm glad I booked the Majestic. Location - superb for sightseeing, transport links, and shops. I felt safer staying near the Paseo de Gracia at night than other areas such as Las Ramblas and Bario de Gothico. Rooftop views stunning.Classical double room adequate, clean with a comfortable bed. Would have liked tea/coffee making facilities to have been provided. Quality breakfast with good choice of food (if you're after a full-English breakfast, don't eat here). Interior decor very tastefully furnished. Leisure facilities a little disappointing - pool very small - hot-tub would be nice. If you're looking for a central hotel with that special something, then I recommend the Majestic.
