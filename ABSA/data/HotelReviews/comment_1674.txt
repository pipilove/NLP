Modern and Artsy

We booked the Hotel Max for a weekend getaway. We chose this hotel because there was a Travelzoo deal where the Queen of Art room was $139.00/night - This was a pretty good deal, compared to over $200.00/night for other hotels in the area. Parking was very steep at $30.00/night, so we opted to park in the office building across the street. For those that don't mind leaving their car outdoors overnight, there was an open-air parking lot that seemed more economical.The room itself was a bit small, but there were only two of us and we only had an overnight bag. If you have more luggage than one large suitcase, you might not want to stay there. It feels like staying in a guest room at a friend's place, rather than staying in a hotel room. Our room had a nice view of the courhouse.The LCD TV was nice, as was the Aveda toiletries. Terrible coffee, but decent tea. The bed was extremely comfortable, but the sheets were a bit scratchy. Although we didn't take advantage, there was a neat pillow menu and a spiritual menu. The location of the hotel was decent. We were within walking distance of downtown attractions and the Pike Place market. It is also about 2 blocks from the Greyhound station.Would I stay at this hotel again? Yes, if it was around $100.00 per night. Any more and I would choose to stay elsewhere..
