Ok for one night but freezing bathroom!

Certainly a good position if you need car parking - but the rooms whilst clean and tidy are rather dark and uninviting - in our case the shower/WC was long overdue a refit - rather grubby and VERY COLD - absolutely no heating at all - the owners are very nice and helpful - As we used it to stay overnight after a long flight it was ok but I would not want to spend much time here. Also very pricey for what you got - staying in a Marriott the following two nights was cheaper and luxurious in comparison.
