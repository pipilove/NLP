Minor Grievances

My dream was to visit Paris. For my honeymoon, my husband and I decided to go to Paris for 5 nights and Greece for two weeks. I decided to start my search for a hotel through Trip advisory. Even though this hotel was only a 3 star hotel, we decided that the reviews were too great to pass it up. I definitely wanted a superior room with a view of the Eiffel Tower. My french is not the greatest so a asked a dear friend who is Parisian to call the hotel and find out how we can be guaranteed a room with a view from the bedroom. She called and we followed their instructions when booking our hotel. The reception assured us if we asked for a certain room in our booking, it would be given to us because we were booking 8 months in advance. Even after the hotel was booked, our friend called the hotel to confirm we received a room with a view. You can imagine our surprise when we did not receive this room. When we went down to the front desk their answer was that we must have misunderstood them when we booked and a room with a view is not guaranteed. I don't understand how one Parisian cannot understand another, there is no language barrier. Other than the view, the room was o.k. and the area was great. Most of the staff was helpful, yet if you have a complaint, do not expect much, there is a complete attitude change. I would recommend this hotel if it is just a family visiting Paris, but if it is a romantic getaway I would try somewhere else.
