Overpriced but in a great location

First of all the location is just fantastic and in all honesty that's what you're paying for because at æ‹¢140 a night (without breakfast!!) the overall quality of the rooms doesn't justify it.It was mid winter in Sydney and our room was always a bit cool even with the AC set to 30C !!! and it was also disappointingly small in comparison to rooms we've had at various Mandarin Orientals and Hyatts.Reception and Concierge are helpful but we booked an early check in but did not recieve it but we were given a courtesy room. We stayed here for four nights at the beginning of our 3 week trip and when we came back to Sydney to fly back to the UK we stayed at the Rendevous Stafford in The Rocks which was about half the price and our room was twice as good (complete with well equipped Kitchenette) and breakfast was included.We would not stay at the Marriot again if the Rendevous had rooms.
