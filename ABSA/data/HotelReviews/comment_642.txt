Great location, good hotel, clean large room with outdated decor

Had a great stay in Berlin in May. Everything about the hotel was good, while the location was great. Short walks to K-damm, Savignyplatz, and zoo. Enjoyed the hospitality and helpfulness of the Savoy Berlin staff. Staff gave accurate restaurant and transportation recommendations, and dry cleaning was performed timely and skillfully. Enjoyed the size of the room and bathroom. But I was quite surprised at the decor of the room - seemed like it hadn't been updated since the 80's. But to us, this didn't matter. Space, cleanliness, large functional bathroom, and new bed made up for the somewhat odd decor of the room. Also liked the nice touch of having a bottle of mineral water in the room. Comfortable large and clean. Recommended.
