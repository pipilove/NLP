Great hotel

Here with work function for 2 days... excellent place, however, appointments (ie: fittings) in the rooms are the only thing that hold me back from giving a 5 rating - the appointments are abit old fashioned - early 90s than recently fitted high-end hotels. But that's a real picky issue. IT'S A LOVELY HOTEL! Great location for work event. Food is good.Beautiful lobby areas and great service.PS: I have no idea how much my company is paying for this
