Impeccable

We were given a very warm welcome when we arrived at the lobby of the Swissotel. It is a rather unusual set up whereby you have to get into a lift to go up to the reception area for check in. The lady at the reception greeted us as soon as we got out of the lift and the check in was quick, without any hassle. The room is large and comfortable. We love the bathroom, very modern and clean. If you are a espresso lover, well this is for you. There is an espresso machine in the room. It is easy to use and the quality of the espresso produce by the machine is good. A very thoughtful gesture on the part of the hotel, by providing a good range of stationery for the guest in the room and you can use the keyboard to send email in the room.The location is great, within walking distant to the Christmas market and all the nice shops. In fact, we walked to the Tiergarten and beyond, to the Berlin wall, Check point Charlie etc. As for restaurants, there are a few very nice restaurants nearby, especially the ones referred to by the hotel.We really enjoyed our breakfast there. The yoghurt is great. A great selection of pastries, breads, fruits, salads, cold meat (great smoked salmons), and lots more.We will gladly stay here again and if in doubtful, we will choose to stay in Swissotel in other cities.
