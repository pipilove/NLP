Great Location, But Some Problems

The location of this hotel is wonderful. Easy walking distance to shops, restaurants and historic sights. My room was well appointed. I do wish that the staff were more accomodating. I didn't have any bottled water left in the fridge in my room and so I went down to the bar that is just off the main lobby and asked for a glass of water. I was told to Sit down and we will bring it to you. I did just that, but no one ever came to bring me the glass of water. I then walked over to the front desk, and requested that some bottled water be brought up to my room from room service. It didn't come, so I then had to leave the hotel, walk to a restaurant up the street, where they sold me some bottled water, that I brought back to my room. My room was not cleaned until very late in the day even though I had the Please clean my room sign hung on my door since early morning. In short, if the service at this hotel were up to par, it would be a good choice. Because I couldn't even get a glass of water or a bottle of water at this hotel, I will look elsewhere for my next stay. Oh, and on check out, they had charged me for the bottled water that they did not bring me, so of course, I protested , and they reluctantly took it off of my bill.
