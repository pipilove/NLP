Terrible, dont even think about it

I hated staying there. First of all it seems like this hotel works a lot with school trips, sports competition groups etc, so there are always a bunch of American teenagers or randy and rowdy young crowd shouting about, you can't even walk through the corridors, as they all sit and chat in corridors. Unless you are nostalgic about your boarding school days, this hotel is no go. But the last straw was when they said there would not be any water at all for a duration of 5 hours. It was apparently due to a central maintanenance, but they did not warn me about this when I booked the hotel. Service staff is very slow and unsymphathetic. Also, when I first arrived the hotel there was a junkie sitting in the lobby, and they had to bring police and remove him. Food is also very bad and not worth the money. The only good thing about this hotel is that it is rather central, but hey, Sydney is so small that you can walk about from almost anywhere, and there are many value hotels nearby, so it is not good enough reason to stay in this ultra crap hotel
