Best service ever

I have just returned from a 3 night stay at the Ritz Carlton Barcelona. The hotel is just magnificent and the service is impeccable. Since the moment we checked in we were treated as if we were celebrities! Doorman Jose Ramon welcomed us with a smile and kindly showed us the way to the lobby on the first floor. We were given an amazing corner room by Renata from front desk who also took her time to escort us to our suite on the 19th floor. Bellman Oriol brought the luggage to our room and told us everything we needed to know about the hotel facilities. Marta and Carlos from concierge were also very helpful and made reservations for botafumero(fantastic shellfish at a price)tenorio(trendy restaurant near ramblas) cangrejo loco(very casual but great paela). The tea saloon is beautiful and waitress Latiffa so friendly and attentive. The spa on the 43rd floor is out of this world and the views are just breathtaking. I have been to many luxury hotels and after my stay at this Ritz Carlton I can assure this is the best service I have ever experienced in my whole life. Congratulations to the hotel Arts for having such fine staff!
