Expensive, ordinary service

Yes, this is a good location, but the hotel itself is nothing special, and, in my view, overpriced for what you get. The staff were not particularly helpful, and the room, while clean, was pretty small, with ridiculously small storage space, no tea or coffee making facilities, not even any shampoo provided (and there was a HIDEOUS painting on the wall)! The breakfast was, at best, mediocre, and we suffered from a ridiculous rule of only one key per room - when I inadvertently went out with the key, my wife was unable to leave the room until I returned because they refused access to another key if she left.The room was also far too cold, and the heating system was inoperative when we wanted to warm it up.For 185 euros a night (including their requirement for a full night's tariff when we arrived at 7.30 am), it's just not good value for mine.
