Laura Meith

I was visiting from a three day layover flight from Boston, and I wanted to visit the wharf. I was recommended to the hotel from a dear friend of mine. The whole trip was ruined by the guest service of the hotel. They say they pride themselves on being the best in guest service but I was not impressed at all. During my stay I complained about a dent that was put in my rental car by a valet, and I was directed to speak with the Assistant General Manager Laura Meith. She was rude and insincere about repairing the damage done to my vehicle. I will never stay there again because of this incident.The valet parking was overpriced, the service was terrible, and the coffe was cold. Take my word for it, stay at the Hilton or the Marriot.
