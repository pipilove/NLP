An excellent base for central Paris

The hotel was just as expected - excellent in every way. We arrived on the Eurostar into Gare du Nord and then just a few Metro stops to Boulevard St Michel followed by a couple of minutes walk to the hotel. When we first arrived I thought we might have been disturbed by noise at night as the area was so busy but the double glazed windows kept all noise out. (air con available for the summer) Our room on the 2nd floor was small but very recently refurbished and the bed was as comfortable as ours at home! I don't think it would be worth paying for a bigger corner room as you'll want to be out all day visiting Paris. The bathroom had a bath with a shower over it and was large in comparison to the bedroom. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel but went to the boulangerie just next door - wonderful pastries. I'd definitely recommend this hotel!
