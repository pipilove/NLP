Single Beds Are Terrible

Stayed at this hotel for work training with another colleague. We were booked into a twin room with twin beds for 3 nights. The beds are tiny, reception say they are 2 feet 6 inches wide but this does not allow for the tapering at the side of the bed. On the second night I came back to the room to find the bed just pulled up. Sheets not tucked in (because they were too small) and the blanket still as I had left it that morning. I changed rooms that night to a queen room with sofa bed. Much better. Whatever you do don't book the rooms with 2 single beds if you are an adult!
