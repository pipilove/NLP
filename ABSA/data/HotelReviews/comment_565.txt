Fantastic!!

This hotel is superb! It's in an ideal location if you don't mind walking and taking in the sights. It's ideal if you don't want to be taling taxis everywhere. We tended to walk down the Ramblas early morning and stay out until 3ish and then go back to the hotel to relax by the roof-top pool. Towels are provided which is bonus if your just on a city break - extra packing room! You can even ring down to the bar for drinks whilst you sun-bathe. The rooms are of an excellent quality, contempory design with good air conditioning. We arrived at 10am in the morning and were allowed to check in. Over-all if I went back I would definatley stay here again and have recommended it to many friends.Kirsten  Scott, Staffs UK.
