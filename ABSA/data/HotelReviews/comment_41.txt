Under no circumstances a 5 star hotel

You will have read from other irrate clients that this is not a 5 star service hotel. The prices are very high, even for a 5 star hotel.My problems began when i arrived early for check in- 10am. Despite being told several times over the phone that I would not have a problem getting a room with a canal view, on arrival with my girlfriend for a special stay in Amsterdam i was told that the only way of getting a room at 10am was paying an additional 30 euros. As you can imagine i refused- not a good way to start your holiday. The room was rather mediocre. Once again for 290 euros a night this room was rather depressing. Views looked out to another building almost immediatly opposite and the lack of light was depressing (no ceiling light). Their was a tray of dirty food when we arrived to the room, two hours later still there. Someone came to fill the mini-bar whilst still sleeping, fair enough, it is a job that needs to be done. However, it does take the micky that someone else knocks on the door offering the same service whilst someone is already in your room.The staff were ok, nothing amazing, once again, a 3/4 star service. To all their fairness they refunded back 1/3 of my fee, that still leaves 200 euros for the night which is still a ludicrous price for that hotel- My advise? Don't bother.
