Low budget, clean Berlin hotel

The Hotel Ambassador has a pleasant front desk staff and a good location (close to the Zoo, Tiergarten, the metro and buses), but it does not have the best rooms. They are very clean, but the decor is Stalin-esque and the beds were not comfortable. If you're traveling on a budget, this is a good hotel to consider just test your bed before accepting the room!
