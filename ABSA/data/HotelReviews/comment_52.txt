Generally a good Amsterdam hotel in a great location. A few small defects spoiled it for us. Original check in clerk was quite snooty and unfriendly. The room was good but the double bed was actually two beds pushed together with separate sheets etc. We asked for smoking room but didn't get it. Neighbours were noisey. The cabbie that the hotel called for us to get us to the airport did a tour and it was 17 Euro more than the inward trip. He seemed to know the snooty guy). BUT, bar staff and luggage people were very friendly. Only one beer on tap, though. Wouldn't stay again.
