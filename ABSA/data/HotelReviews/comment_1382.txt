Ok for the price...

Booked two rooms on Priceline for $139 each, just an overnight stay while flying home the next morning. Check in was good, rooms both ready, and we upgraded with no problems. Room was very small for 4, we apparently had an outside room, because trucks crashed around all night loading and unloading. Tried to tip the maids for 2 extra towels as there were 4 of us and it was a HUGE problem, apparently no more than 4 towels per room? Didn't want to pay for the mini-bar, but frig leaked all over floor. When maintenance guy came in, he blamed us for turning it down, it was in a locked cabinet! Asked for a wake up call and did not get it. One male working the desk the morning of 10/20 was rushed, rude, so checked out without talking to them. Hotel is clean, very convenient to the Wharf and shopping. Would not stay here again, due to noise and staff, but ok for the price, if I would have paid rack rate, I would have been more upset.
