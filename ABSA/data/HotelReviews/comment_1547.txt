Don't stay for the hotel - stay for the location

Make no mistake - the Moore is pretty much a dump. Its old and any improvements/repairs all look completely half baked. However, everything was functional, the price was not bad ($91 plus tax for two queens and a roll away), and I thought the location was perfect for us - close to Pikes Place market (can buy anything), the Waterfront (Bainbridge Ferry/shops, seafood restaraunts), Belltown (pubs/clubs), and the Monorail for a trip to the Space Needle area. I thought Seattle was great - plenty of specialty shops, restaraunts, coffee shops, pubs, and clubs, plus the water. Loved it.
