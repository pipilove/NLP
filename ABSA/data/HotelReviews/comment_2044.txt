It was nice.

I was just at the Travelodge a few days ago and it was very good. Average hotel, nothing magnificent, but definitely good for traveling. A small  complaint would be the keys for the rooms. Whenever they came into contact with metal, they would de-activate. So if you are intending on staying there and if you want to avoid unecessary trips to reception, keep the key seperate from metals or keys. Also, the breakfast wasn't exactly ideal, but the hashbrowns made up for that. Overall, a pretty decent place to stay while in Sydney!
