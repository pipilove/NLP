Hotel Jazz hit a sour note

I was very disappointed in the service we received from some of the front desk people. I accidentally left a scarf and leather jacket at the hotel. I requested they send it to me, at my expense and after I confirmed w/ the staff that they had it. It was never returned. This hotel also doesn't have an onsite restaurant that offers lunch or dinner. There were thankfully places around to eat, but it would have been convenient to have onsite options. Lastly, when we arrived, the woman at the front desk complained to us that we had too much luggage. Well, there were four of us and everyone had a bag. Not a great way to welcome patrons.
