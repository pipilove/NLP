NOT a fan of this Hotel

This hotel was VERY dissapointing. Firstly we were not informed of the hotel's change of name and spent 15 minutes trying to locate it! The room itself (a large corner room) was spacious, but filthy. Stains on the chairs, duvet cover and floor, dust on the telephone and bedside tables. The only redeeming factor was the bathroom which was superb with a big deep bath. None of our power points worked and we were told to flick the trip switch to activate the room's electricity. Also tv and alarm clock were of a very poor standard for what promises to be a luxery hotel. The bed was not made very well - twisted sheets - what looked like a rushed job. Our bags took forever to arrive and the stink of stale smoke (even though a non-smoking room was requested) was disgusting. For the cost of the room (a reduced internet rate of $245) this hotel was definitely NOT worth it. I am just glad we spent minimal time in this horrid room - only staying 1 night, opting for somewhere else the following night. I would NEVER reccommend this hotel to anyone.
