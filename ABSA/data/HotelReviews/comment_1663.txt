Avoid this place

I bought into the W thing early on but I am so over it. Everything in this hotel seems darker than even the other W's I stayed in. When you come in from walking around the city you cannot see a thing let alone find a key. And the loud, thumping music that fills the lobby is not what I want to hear after a long work day. I could not even hear the desk staff. The rooms are way over priced (give me the Sheraton or Westin dream beds!) and I want to see if my room is clean (can't in the dark.) And for a place so dark- blinds on the window that let in all the outside light when you finally do get in bed. They offered to hang black-out curtains so they must have heard this before. I took them up on it the next day. it was a black metal rod crammed in the window with thin, black fabric safety pinned over the rod! Not much better than the blinds! And it is Seattle - NO COFFEE MAKER! Don't even ask about their much touted restauarant - Just dont'!
