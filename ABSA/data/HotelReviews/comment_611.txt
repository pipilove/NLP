No Westin Heavenly Beds

We stayed in the Westin Grand Berlin in July 2007. In spite of the fact that the reservation we made through the Starwood Hotels website said our rooms would have Westin's renowned Heavenly Beds, we found that only a few suites actually have the beds. The beds we were subjected to were firm to the point of being like sleeping on a sidewalk. Had we not been told in advance how wonderful our stay would be because of the Heavenly Beds, we might not have been as unpleasantly surprised.The beds and fitness center made it definitely not like a usual Westin stay. The pool was lovely but the work-out room was small, dimly-lit, and hot. There were only two treadmills (one of which was broken), a Lifecycle bike, and four computerized weight machines. There was also one ratty, old floor mat. Almost everything in Germany had English translations, but not the machines there. With the highest breakfast prices we've ever seen, it would have been nice to have in-room beverage stations/coffee makers like one usually finds in Westins. There's a fantastic deli across the street where we purchased breakfast for four for half the price of a single continental breakfast at the hotel.The hotel had two positives: the concierge service and the location. The room price was actually pretty reasonable.
