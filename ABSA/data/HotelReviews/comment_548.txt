Great Place to Stay AAAAA+++++ 

We had an EXCELLENT stay here Nov. 20-25, 2005. All the good reviews you'll read below are true. This is a real gem, especially for the price and location. Rooms are modern, clean, large and comfortable. The staff is friendly and helpful. The pool area (although too cold for us to use while we were there) is much nicer than in the photos. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!
