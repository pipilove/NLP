Friendly Great hotel, great location just off Union Square.

Staff very friendly and helpful - nothing a bother. Only drawback no tea/coffee facilities in the room but they do have free tea and coffee in the bar in the morning. My room was just beside the lift but you wouldn't have known as never heard anything and I wasn't an early riser. Lots of people I met were leaving early so you would have thought I would hear them.Hotel restaurant good value and food excellent.
