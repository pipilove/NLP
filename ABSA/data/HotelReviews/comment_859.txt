A great find in Berlin!

We spent three days at the Berlin Courtyard and really enjoyed it. The rooms are large, clean and quiet. And as an added bonus, the rooms include a refridgerator. A definate plus because the hotel is very close to a grocery store. The front desk staff was incredibly helpful and friendly. Finally, the location was perfect for sightseeing. It was only about two blocks to Checkpoint Charlie. The only negative to the hotel was the high cost of internet access for the lobby computers. Bring your own computer or go to an internet cafe.
