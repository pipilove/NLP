Great SF Home Base!!!

We stayed here for two nights during the week and were very satisfied with the room. The rooms are clean and basic, and included a fridge and microwave. Also, included each morning was a small continental breakfast available at the office. And, to my surprise, the friendly staff gave us some tourist advice! The big benefit to the Castle Inn was the free parking. Parking - a rare commodity in San Francisco. The secret to seeing San Francisco is using the public transportation. We left our car at the Castle Inn the whole time during our stay. The only issue with the Castle Inn is that it's not that close to the major attractions like Chinatown and Fisherman's Wharf. It's walkable, but it would be a very long walk. But, you can get anywhere in the City by public bus - only takes a few minutes. We'll look forward to staying at the Castle Inn in the future! Bon Voyage!
