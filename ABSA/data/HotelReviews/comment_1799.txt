Not a good experience

I booked this hotel for a special occassion. I did it on a hotel booking website as a gift to someone. When they arrived they were treated so rudely I couldn't believe it. As a frequent business traveler I have never had such a poor experience. The rudeness went right up the line to the general manager. My travel service had to step in and save the day. They blamed me for everything. I was so dissappointed.
