Stayed here for a long weekend the hotel is within easy walking distance from the city centre and less than 50m from the closest tram stopThe room was small but spotlessly clean,nice fresh continental breakfast each morningstaff couldn't do enough for us with complimentary drinks nearly evey time we went to receptionThe reception area has loads of leaflets on places to visit and the staff are more than happy to offer adviceMore than happy to keep bags safe on early check in /late check outThe only negative would be the stairs might be steep for some people but this is normal in Amsterdam
