Very Nice!

Stayed at this hotel for our 1st year anniversary. We choose it because of the reviews from this website. The hotel was very very nice, the staff are excellent. It is a very modem hotel in a good loctaion. We mailed the hotel and asked for a nice room, which they gave us with a brillinat view.
