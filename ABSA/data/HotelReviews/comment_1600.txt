Poor Quality - Poor Service - Under Construction - Attitude

I was extremely disappointed with my stay at Seattle Sheraton. The service was horrendous, the beds were improperly made, front desk had attitude. There was no concierge and the business center was not available because of construction. I travel 3 of 4 weeks a month and found this property to be less than satisfactory and the service provided was unpleasant. The front desk compensated us with 3 $15 food credits for the bedding problems, which were never corrected. The beds are short sheeted which causes the bed to unravel and we found our selves sleeping on the bare mattress (disgusting) when we woke up in the morning. The $15 food credits did not satisfy us due to the poor quality of food, service and cleanliness. The food in the restaurant was cold, service was slow, and each time I ate in there (the first when we didn't know any better and the 2nd 2nd time was because of the food coupons) - either the silverware was dirty or the water glasses and coffee cups were dirty, and expensive breakfast buffet for $25. The pool area was poorly ventilated and I cut my foot on a broken drain cover in the whirlpool, shortly after that a young boy sliced his foot open and a house doctor was called. I mentioned my foot at check out the next morning and all they said was they were sorry. The noise from the construction was annoying at 6am and we were not notified in advance that services promised (business center, concierge) would not be available. Parking at $28 was obscene and the $1.50 for 6 oz. bottle of water in the vending machine was ridiculous - the picture showed a full size water bottle. Horrible - absolutely horrible.
