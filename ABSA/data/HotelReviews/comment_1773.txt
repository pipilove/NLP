Best location and view ever - HORRIBLE Hotel

the view to this hotel is AWSOME...if you get a room on the street. If you book the chea[est room, you will get a room with a view of a WALL. The view from the roof is nothing short of amazing as well. There are many fabulous restaurants nearby... This almost makes it worth staying at again, almost.The lobby is lovely, the staff is terrific... but the rooms are flea bags. Very - very dated! I met other guests (that were a bit sketchy) that live there on a semi permanent basis, which tells you a bit. They get their rooms for $50 a night thru some vocational school. The decor is horrible, the furniture and bed is very old and crotchity, the TV's are old, the bedding feels like maybe you should go buy a sleeping bag. Seriously, in short the rooms themselves are really terrible. The rooms are comparable to a run down Motels 6.What huge potential this hotel has... desperately needs remodeling. Desperately. If they painted and got new beds I would probably go back.
