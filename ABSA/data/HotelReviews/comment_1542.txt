Avoid like the plague

I did not feel safe at this hotel. Couples may feel more comfortable but I could see the shuttle bus driver was not impressed by my hotel of choice.I was booked in here for 4 nights [ a single female traveller]. When I got there they told me that I could only have three nights with an en suite and the other night I would have to move room and share a bathroom. Totally unacceptable as a lone female. When I complained they told me tough move elsewhere. Which I did at 6.30 the next morning [I arrived at the Moore at 10 pm too late to find somewhere else]. I moved to the Inn on Queen Anne which was slightly more expensive but had a kitchenette, friendly staff and a much better vibe.
