Wonderful hotel...book now!

Just returned from a four night stay at The Argonaut. The hotel is situated in the best bit of Fisherman's Wharf. On the whole the Wharf is tacky, but not as bad as I expected. The proximity to the cable car stop is a definate bonus (especially if you are on your own and worried about safety).The staff were friendly at all times and always acknowledged you, and you always received a friendly welcome from the doorman. The decor, although wacky, is very tasteful and not at all overpowering.I had a room facing the courtyard (a view would have been nice, but I was hardly in the room during daylight hours). It was totally spotless, you would honestly think that it had been furnished and renovated especially for your visit. Lots of extra touches that set the hotel apart, such as flat screen TV, DVD, Starbucks coffee, modern phone and clock radio. Free internet in the lobby was a huge benefit and was not abused. Ate breakfast in the hotel a few mornings and was impressed with the food and the service (unlike some other reviewers.)I would definately return to The Argonaut on my next visit to San Francisco- during my time there I saw no other hotel that I would rather stay in. If you plan on staying at the Wharf, stay here. The other chain hotels (Holiday Inn, Radisson etc) look run down and dated from the outside.
