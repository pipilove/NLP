Problems with Website

I have not stayed at the hotel, but did make an online reservation through the hotel's official website. This has proven impossible to cancel online. The hotels cancellation web-page is non-responsive and my hotel-issued booking number is too many digits to fit in the dialog box.I was especially concerned about this when I noted the other reviewer's comments on this site which indicates that he was charged even when he e-mailed his cancellation.Obviously this hotel has problems.
