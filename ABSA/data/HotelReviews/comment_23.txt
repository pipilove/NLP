Never go to this hotel

We stayed in this hotel 3 nights with my wife when visiting Amsterdam. This was the worth hotel of this category we've ever stayed:1) 1h (yes ONE hour) to check in2) we booked a none smoking room, we got one that was smelling very heavily the cigar (so an other 20mn to change and get an other room)3) they were sorry for this, so gave us a voucher for 2 free drinks at the bar....4) when wanting to use it, i left the paper in the room, told it to the barm tender that wanted anyway to see it or you pay. I said that i was not willing to pay, and that he could call the reception His answer :you pay or I call the security....which HE DID !!!!This was the first day, nice....unfortunatly we pre-paid the 3 nights (325 euros per night...not cheap for Amsterdam), so were not willing to move. I told in their survey what i was thinking about their hotel, the answer  we are very sorry, and hope to see you again at the Pulitzer. Are they joking ?!?Everybody now that i meet, i tell them to NEVER go to this hotel.
