Very lovely hotel

Had a lovely time after deciding upon this hotel for our honeymoon. The staff were lovely, they upgraded our room to overlook the Arc because I emailed them in my poor French. Metro station to the Central Line wonderfully close, beautiful views.It was noisy though in the mornings with a lot of doors banging shut and cleaning going on, but hey we didn't care - we were on honeymoon!Just one thing - if you have long hair like me you might want to bring a hairdryer as the one in our bathroom was very weak and the handle heated up after using it a while.All in all we will be back there.
