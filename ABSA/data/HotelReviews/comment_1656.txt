Not a Fan

My husband and I are Starwood Preferred Gold guests and try to stay at Starwood Hotels at any chance we can get. Our favorite experience was at a W in San Francisco, so we were very excited about the W Seattle.We arrived after flying all day from DC at the W late afternoon. There was no bellman out from to help us with our 3 suitcases, and we couldn't get through the front door because there was a crowd of 4 smokers rudely blocking the way. Once we got inside, there was a small line to check in, and some man walked in and asked if he could cut (no way!). I must say, once we finally got to the room, it was nice and modern. The bed was comfortable, but it was nothing spectacular. So much of a hotel experience is the customer service, and there really wasn't any customer service to speak of here. One other thing that I didn't love was that the hotel was perched on a VERY steep hill. My husband and I are young and fit, but after a long day of walking, it was always annoying to come into the lobby completely winded after hiking the hill.I would not recommend this hotel- go for the Westin nearby instead!
