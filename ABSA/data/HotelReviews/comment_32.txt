1st class location, Basil Fawlty staff

The Hotel's location is brilliant, and within walking distance of the rest of the city. The Moroccan door and bar staff likewise were helpful, polite and efficient. Bad news is that the Dutch (and/or European) staff on reception and management were lazy, rude, complacent and could not manage anything without conflict including the printing a bill when checking out. After refusing them a carte blanche on my credit card they remarkably had a working computer and printer, after claiming billing problems. They then tried to pull the same trick on Asian members of my traveling party. When I left, the lobby resembled the port at Rotterdam all morning because someone could not organize somewhere else (e.g. an empty conference room?) to put the luggage of a German coach holiday. Given the attitude of the senior staff, I think they may be getting more English stag parties and elderly coach tourists than those the Starwood group desire.
