The Rex was the Best!

Found Hotel Rex on the hotel.com website, did a virtual tour and decided that was the place to be -- it was centrally located, had a wonderful hotel library bar, lots of art and books. I was greeted warmly at the front desk, enjoyed the wine reception and had a great dinner at the restaurant. And, my room was lovely. Absolutely recommend it. Also stayed at the Water's Edge in Tiberon on New Year's Eve -- another fabulous place. For those who enjoy a different hotel experience, these are a find!
