Great location, rooms and staff but avoid the breakfast

We have recently returned from a 3 night stay at the Universal. The hotel is great, nice large rooms that are well serviced. The staff were incredibly helpful and spoke excellent English. The Universal is 5 mins from Las Ramblas... and perfect for the Metro. I'll definitely stay there again.Now for the bad news. We had the breakfast on our second day. The food was good but I was shocked to see staff members chasing customers down the corridor because they had left the breakfast room with an apple! I think it is fair enough that you aren't allowed to make a packed lunch courtesy of the breakfast buffet but they weren't even allowing a dry roll to leave the room. Take the advice of having breakfast at the hotel to the left... much better, a quarter of the price and a nice atmosphere.One last point. One of our friends uses a wheelchair and so had a specially equipped room. These rooms are all internal...no choice about that, also they only have twin beds (not much use for couples). Make sure you are on a higher floor as the lower floors get a lot of kitchen noise and my friends had to move floors to get some sleep.
