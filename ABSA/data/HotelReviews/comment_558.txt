A Love/Hate Relationship

We chose the Hotel Jazz for our October visit to Barcelona based on its location and the many great reviews on this site. The location was excellent, the room was modern and clean, the bed was good, and the reception staff friendly and helpful (except for one icy female staff member). But there were several serious problems. First, the water was undrinkable, full of chlorine. When we mentioned this, we were told that everyone in Barcelona drinks bottled water because it always tastes like chlorine. We had to drag 1 1/2 liter bottles of water from a market several blocks away. For the equivalent of 25 cents a bottle, a hotel of this caliber should provide it to guests. Second, the two English language TV channels both had terrible reception all during our five night stay. We were told that it was the fault of the satellite company, but when we moved to a hotel near the airport for the next two nights, the reception was just fine. Third, the Metro noise was very noticeable on the sixth floor. For a hotel costing about $225 a night including two breakfasts, plus over $26 a night for parking, these conditions are unacceptable.
