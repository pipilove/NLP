Castle Inn - Great Location

We stopped here for 4 nights. I booked directly with the Inn and they were easy to deal with. They responded quickly to all my email queries and were very helpful. On arrival I was a bit put out, as the rooms looked a bit dark and shabby. The continental breakfast was limited, and some rooms will suffer from traffic noise. However, the maid service was very good and the location was spot on. It was easily walkable to Fishermans Wharf and the buses and cable cars were just a few minutes walk away. There were also plenty of places to eat and some small shops just minutes away. Getting to any where from here was easy. The front desk staff also let us know the places to go and where not to venture and they also gave us maps and a great list of buses to use to get to see all the sights. Overall, the Inn was good value for money, location was excellent and we enjoyed our stay.
