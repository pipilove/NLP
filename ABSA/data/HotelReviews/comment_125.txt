great location

The Park Hotel was a great choice! the location was great, the hotel staff was friendly, and the rooms were nice and clean!The location is very close to the the Leidseplein. A 5 minute walk! Also near by the hotel were other high end shops and art galleries. Which was great!The hotel staff was very friendly! They all spoke english! Which always helpful. The BEST thing about the hotel was the size of the rooms! They were very spacious. I can actually leave my HUGE suitcase wide open in the middle of the room and still have space to walk around! Visiting from Los Angeles (where hotel rooms are much larger than typical European hotel rooms), this room was perfect for 4 days! The room was very neat and clean! the bathrooms were updated and new as well! The bed sheets were clean and the bed was very comfortable. I was very pleased with this hotel. i will definately stay here again the next time i visit amsterdam.
