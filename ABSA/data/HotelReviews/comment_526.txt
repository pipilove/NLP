An excellent hotel - perfect for a Barcelona stay

We loved everything about the Pulitzer. We made two separate visits during our trip to Spain. Both rooms were beautiful, the staff was helpful, all services worked according to plan, the restaurant and bar were excellent. The rooms were (in our opinion, but we're from SF) spacious, particularly the bathrooms. An extra bonus point for geeks out there: the WiFi service actually worked -- at all times!The location made it easy to get around Barcelona, being a 2 minute walk to the Metro, and/or providing easy cab access. It is refreshing to see an expensive hotel actually meet or exceed all expectations. This hotel would be our first choice if we returned to Barcelona, and we highly recommend it to anyone visiting the city.
