Nice hotel and great location.

My boyfriend and I went to Paris for my birthday weekend and really enjoyed our stay at the Hotel des Grands Hommes. It's in a great location with beautiful views of the Pantheon and less than 10mins walk from the Notre Dame. (Its also very easy to get to if you are travelling from London by Eurostar)The hotels decor is very unique keeping in style with its location. Our room was very clean and extremely quiet at night. We found the staff friendly and they also spoke excellent English. There are plenty of bars/cafes/restaurants in the locality. For a really nice meal reasonably priced there is a lovely French restaurant closeby called Le Vin Qui Danse.We booked through the Hotels own website which worked out cheaper than some of the general websites as they offer some good direct online reductions. Overall we had a fantastic time in Paris and would definetly recommend this hotel!
