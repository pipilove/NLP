Great location

We thoroughly enjoyed our three night stay at this hotel. Situated on La Ramblas it was a fab location for visiting the attractions of this wonderful city. Our room overlooked La Ramblas with a tiny balcony (wide enough to stand on!). Yes it was quite noisy, but not bad enough to keep us awake, even on the Friday night when the fiesta began! The room was a reasonable size. The bed was comfortable. Tea  coffee making facilities available. The staff were courteous. Marti on reception (seemed to be on duty the whole time we were there) was extremely helpful recommending fabulous restaurants. The Patagonia is definitely worth a visit - beef to die for! The roof terrace gave us great views over the city. The pool is tiny and was very cold at the time of our visit. But plenty of places to sit and relax. The only downside was the bar prices.....be aware!We loved Barcelona and will definitely return to this hotel.
