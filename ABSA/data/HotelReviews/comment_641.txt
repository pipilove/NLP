Not for non-smokers!

If you're a non-smoker, don't stay here! Although I was on the nonsmoking floor(5th) both the hallway and my room smelled of smoke. Why? The door of the cigar bar on the ground floor is left open and the smoke wafts through the hotel. Housekeeping leaves your windows open to air it out. One evening I returned to my room to find both windows open. The rooms need a re-do. The hotel was remodeling the 6th floor while I was there. Also, as it's near the Zoo rail station and the windows are not double-paned you will here trains all the time. The location is great. The restaurant staff is wonderful. The front desk staff was great during the week but the weekend front desk staff can be rude. Next time I'd stay at the more modern Ku'damm 101(owned by the same owners) or the Kempinski Bristol down the block.
