Nice hotel - great view -

We had a Harbour View room wich is the best place to be in that hotel. The room was not very clean when we arrived and I went to the reception to complaint. When we returned from our walk outside, the room had been cleaned and the hotel had put a good bottle of wine on ice in the room to excuse themselves for the situation. It was nice and not expected. Breakfeast buffet is expansive but really good. Lot of business customers and japanse tourists in the hotel. Room are not silent proof and you can hear next room shower from yours. Overall I recommend this hotel.
