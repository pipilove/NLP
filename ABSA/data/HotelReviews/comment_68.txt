Distinctly Average - go elsewhere

I travel extensively in The Netherlands on business and stay in Amsterdam a lot. I usually stay at the Golden Tulip Hotel in the centre which I have always been happy with. For some reason I recently ended up booking the Krasnapolsky and certainly would not want to stay there again. It is not terrible but it is distinctly average.I had requested a non-smoking room but they tried to allocate me a smoking room and when I said I really would not like this they said the hotel was full etc. Then they found a room and the TV did not work. It was not the end of the world but I just wanted a quiet night in so the TV was something I wanted. To cut a long story short it took over an hour and half to try to sort this and they then ended up moving me to another room. The hour and a half wait was prettty poor but what made it frustrating was to keep being told We are on our way now which was quite simply just a succession of lies. Not the end of the world but it was at the end of a long day and getting late for dinner. The room was average and certainly not somewhere you would particularly want to go back to. But there was nothing terribly wrong with it except for the drab decor and well-worn bed.The staff did not show any particular interest. At one stage when I was getting a rather poor response I asked for the manager and was told I am the manager which I found hard to believe.So my advice would be to go elsewhere as there are plenty of alternatives. It is certainly not worth the money and the staff really do not show much interest at all in really looking after you
