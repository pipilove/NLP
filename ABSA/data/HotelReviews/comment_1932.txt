Good but not as good as hoped

I had nowhere else to go from my office's preferred supplier list so had to move hotels into the Four Seasons.Service at front desk was good and very friendly. Nice lobby and public areas (piped muzak can get a bit irritating though).Room was the tiniest I have ever been in but not unpleasant. Furniture OK. There was no view (to be expected as I was on a corporate rate).Bed comfy and super clean linens, surfaces, bathroom etc - no dust or dirt anywhere. Breakfast buffet looked fine from what I saw - I had porridge and it was fine.Data connections bit archaic - fee payable for internet access (take your wireless card! - although if you do, bear in mind this may be a bit flaky if you are in a room on a high floor - the wireless is a bit unpredictable in the city on high rise floors)Excellent shower and great toiletries in the rooms - L'Occitane. Turn down service ok. No iron or ironing board in room which I found a bit surprising.On the whole - nothing offputting but just average stay - to be fair my room was very good value for short notice in Sydney and in such a central location at AUD210 per night.
