Extremely Disappointing

My husband and I stayed at the Terass for two nights in mid-Sept. 2004. We booked a double superior room and we were given a room on the 5th floor w/absolutely no view. (except for a dreary alley way and the back of a run-down apartment building.) There were also a number of things wrong with the room. (1) our phone was broken. (2) there was a heavy ring of mold/mildew in the shower. (3) our tv remote was missing. (4) the bathtub shower fixture was broken. My husband and I asked for another room but we were told none were available. I complained about the broken items and the phone was fixed and some of the mold was removed. Will not stay here again.
