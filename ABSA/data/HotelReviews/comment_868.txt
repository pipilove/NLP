very unpleasant place

very unfriendly staff. Strange rules, you can obtain your reserved room before 4PM. Not very clean, generally, this hotel looks already tired. Small room, cold atmosphere and a pretentious design without means for that. I don't understand why such a place is recommended by some of the prestigious traveller magazines.
