stylish but no substance

The Pulitzer is well located and stylish - as it should be for the priceUnfortunately, the rooms are on the small sideMore importantly, the service we experienced was very patchy -- not good enough at these prices.For just a few examples: The rooms were on two nights not cleaned until afer 5pm even though we had left the room before nine. Asking the staff at front desk to arrange to Fedex a package was a big production, they had little idea what to do. Even worse, a film crew took over the whole lobby and bar area on our last day, and the staff we completely occupied with the chaos. They asked us to wait a few hours to check out, and in the meantime the lobby was unusable to guests. Very disappointing for paying guests.In summary, if style is all you need, great -- but there are better options that are just as cool. We would not stay here again.
