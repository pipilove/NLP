Something missing ?

After reading the reviews on Trip Advisor, my husband  I stayed at the Elysees Regencia for 4 nights in March, so had time to make a considered opinion about the place. I can't really find anything bad to say about the hotel - a couple of gripes, no drawer space in the room, slamming doors from other guests early in the morning , concierge service a bit erractic. The staff are friendly and helpful and the place is spotlessly clean. However there's something missing - atmosphere ! I noticed a piano in the lobby, but nobody playing it. There was hardly ever anybody in the bar, so there wasn't much opportunity to chat with other guests, pass the time of day.If you want peace and quiet then this is the place for you - but if you like your hotels with a bit of life then choose somewhere else.
