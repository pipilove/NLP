First class

Stayed here for 4 nights at the start of a 5 week trip in Australia. Hotel is very central which makes it convenient for all the attractions Sydney has to offer. Room a very good size. Breakfast was first class and really set you up for the day. Staff all very pleasant. I would give this hotel 10 out of 10. Definitely worth the money and I would certainly stay here again.
