Great Position

We have just returned from a week in Barcelona with our two teenage sons.I searched long and hard for the hotel that would allow us to be close to the centre of Barcelona, yet make the most of the coast and have a pool to return to after a hard day's site seeing. The first objective was well satisfied, as the hotel is within easy walking distance of Las Ramblas and the Metro. The beaches were also easily reached by taxi from the hotel costing approximately six euros. The pool, however was a major let down. On the hotel's website it appears to be the size of an Olympic pool, but in reality it was nothing more than an ice cold plunge pool. It was surrounded by a fairly large open space that should, for a five star hotel, have been filled with sun beds. It had about sixteen with the vaste majority of guests having to sit or lay on the floor.We arrived at the hotel in the morning and were told our rooms would be ready at 2pm. We returned at 2.30 and were given the key to our son's room, which was on the seventh floor facing an office block, not good! After six phone calls and six times of being told that our room would be ready in ten minutes, we finally got in at 4.30. Our double room also faced an office block, but did at least have a second window to the side. The rooms were beautifully presented and very well cared for by the cleaners, who scowled at us daily because we chose not to rise until about 10am.To summarise - a grand building, some highly dodgy positioning of rooms and views. A rather souless hotel whose service is not, despite the excellent concierge, that of a five star hotel.
