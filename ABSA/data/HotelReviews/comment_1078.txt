Au revoir et à bientôt

The location of this hotel is just perfect for everything. Eiffel tower and river Seine are in few minutes of walk. Hotel rooms are small, as they usually are in Paris, but very clean and nice. Spotless, I would say. Thank you for cleaning it up every day. Very nice decor. Nice little Patisseries and Boulangeries around the hotel to have breakfast or coffee break. We highly recommend this hotel for its location, exellent service and recently renovated rooms. We had wonderful holiday with my husband, and will come back in Paris and to this carming little hotel. We will not want to stay anywere else when coming back. Great value for the money. Merci.Nina and Kimmo, Finland
