Great European Hotel

Overall, my wife and I had a great stay at this hotel. Paris was wonderful in mid-March and this hotel made it even more so. The price was right, and the hotel was recently remodeled, clean, and up-to-date. The staff was fantastic. All spoke very good English and all were incredibly friendly, at all times of day as we came and went. Speaking from experience, you will not find a better hotel than this in Europe unless you are willing to spend an arm and a leg. The hotel is out of the major tourist districts (great if you want to experience the real Paris), but the location is so convenient. Two Metro stations are within a block or two away, making every major destination in Paris less than about a five minute train ride away. A short walk away from the hotel are some really nice little bakeries and cafes. Grab a couple bakery items at one of the corner bakeries and have a seat at the counter of the Cafe Bleu for a morning cafe au lait. When you first arrive, the Hotel France Albion can be a bit tricky to find. After a long flight from Chicago, it took my wife about an hour looking at maps and dragging our bags around on the Paris streets until we finally located the place. Here's a tip: take the Metro to the station Notre Dame de Lorette, and the hotel is immediately up the street and around the corner. Just search for the station on any of the maps in the metro stations. If you are looking for a great meal on the go at an inexpensive price, try a restaurant called Brioche Doree. Its a local chain, so you'll see them here and there throughout the city. For a real Parisian experience, find the street called Rue Cler and hang out a bit at the cafes and shops. Its not far from the Place des Invalides.
