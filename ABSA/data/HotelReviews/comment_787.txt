Good but not great.

Nice hotel, although nothing special. Good value for money and very central which is a bonus. Let down by the fact it doesn't have a pool. You could do worse if you want a base for sight-seeing but you could do a lot better...Oh yeah, and if you're looking for the ironing board, it's hidden behind the mirror. What's that all about?
