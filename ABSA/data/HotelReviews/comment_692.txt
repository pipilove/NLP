Berlin's SoHo Hotel

Spent five nights and enjoyed the spacious and spotless very bright rooms, modern steam and sauna area with cold plunge, and complete breakfast buffet. The staff was helpful and their food recommendations in the immediate vicinity were right on the mark.Active bar in the evening. Excellent location. Would not hesitate to return.
