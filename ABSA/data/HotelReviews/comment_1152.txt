Rated #1 in my book!

As a family of five (grandmother, mother and three teenage daughters), we stayed here the first week of July for four nights based on reports from this website. We had two family connecting rooms which were perfect - giving the girls some privacy. I believe we had rooms 26  27 - one had a small balcony. They were spacious, quiet and exceptionally clean. The hotel is situated in a very safe area - extremely important for us females - and the staff is top notch. The hotel is small enough that the staff know you by name, don't hesitate to meet your needs and even seem to anticipate your desires. They were very attentive and even one of our girls who is very shy felt comfortable at this hotel and with the staff. She gave the greatest compliment - she said when she returns to Paris on her own, she will stay here! The staff assisted us in securing taxis, tickets and transportation to/from a show, and transportation to the train station. Everything they set us up with was perfect! Even before we arrived at the hotel, we had a special request to hold invitations to a special fashion show (could only be mailed to a Paris address) and they didn't hesitate to accommodate us. When we walked in and announced who we were, they immediately presented the mail for us - we didn't even have to ask. I just can't say enough positive things about this staff. The hotel is well maintained even though the elevator was out of commission for a short period of time one afternoon, they immediately had someone working on it and it was fixed. Location, location, location - GREAT as others have said. I agree with my daughter, when I return to Paris, this is where I will stay!
