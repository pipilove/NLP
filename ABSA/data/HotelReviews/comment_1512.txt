below expectations

There is nothing really seriously wrong with the hotel, but it just doesn't have any wow factor. Positives: Location is great for exploring the city (sight seeing, shopping, restaurants/clubs/bars), concierge was helpful. Deluxe room was big with a good view (18th floor). Negatives: Decor is very plain, nothing special, worn out. Instead of duvet there a blanket placed between two sheets, swimming pool is very very small but also very very dirty, stuff at reception desk doesn't seem to be happy to work there so you also don't get any feeling you came to a good placeRegarding the price we were paying (from 200 to 260USD per night) we expected a bit more. Didn't get it...
