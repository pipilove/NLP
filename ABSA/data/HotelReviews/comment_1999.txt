Awful service and overcharged for the privilege

We stayed at the Sheraton on the Park in Jan 07 and have been thoroughly disappointed with the Hotel. Upon our check out we were shocked to find (on our card statement) that the Hotel had charged us twice for the same room at varying rates. Naturally, one telephones the Hotel to give them the opportunity to correct the problem which we did. After speaking with a reservation staff member, I was informed that they needed to contact a Manager and they would call me back as soon as possible. As the amount on my card which had been tied up needed to be used, I enquired with them as to whether the call would be sometime that night. I was assured that this would happen. Alas no call was received and in fact none was forthcoming the following morning. I had to then follow up again after lunch the next day and was given some spiel about an error being made and they could not do anything about it for a few days. This was completely ridiculous. No real apology or anything. When I enquired as to why I never got a phone call to explain, I was just informed that they did not know. Again no apology. Apparently a Manager is going to call me but I am not holding my breath- they did not really seem to be interested in the problem. I note from this forum that others have also been overcharged so it seems to be a consistent problem for this one star customer service establishment. I could not recommend this Hotel to anyone quite frankly.
