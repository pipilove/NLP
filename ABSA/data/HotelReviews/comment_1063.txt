Good Location, But poor accomodation

The best thing about this hotel is it's location. It is within 5 mins walk of the metro and easy walking distance to all the tourist sites.The staff were very friendly and did their best to help us. However the non-smoking room we asked for smelt of stale tabacco. The rooms were very small but i think this is the norm in Paris. The mattress had sunk in the middle but this was repaired the following day. The bedding and towels were stained and on our last night / morning there was no hot water, so we couldnt have a shower !!It was ok for the 3 nights we were there but would not stay here again.
