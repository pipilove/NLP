excellent location

Just spent 3 nights at this hotel 5th March 04 -8th March 04. The location is excellent and the hotel is very grand. I was a little disappointed with the room consideraing the rate it was small and nothing special, but very clean and confortable beds. The worse thing was the noise from the room above, my husband and I were on the third floor the people staying above on the 4th could have been in the room with us. You could hear their voices quite plain and every footstep, at 4am I was not amused having had no sleep from 1am. I would stay there again but would make sure I was on the top floor.
