For the price you pay, make sure you get one of the better rooms. When we first arrived they tried to put us in a lower level room that looked out directly to a parkade (basically all the cars going up can see you). I made a bit of a stink about it and two rooms later, I got the one I wanted, with a bit of a view for the same price. There's nothing extraordinary about this hotel, the gym is quaint, the rooms are small, the bathroom is actually really big, it was about 1/2 the size of the bedroom...the restaurant is pretty cool.
