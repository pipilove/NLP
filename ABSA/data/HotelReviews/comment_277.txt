A realistic review

We Stayed in room b in the summer of 2006, 2 adults. Choosing this hotel after reading alot of good reviews on this site.First of all all the good things... the location is good. Except the location, theres really nothing good to say about our stay in room b.Theres NO AIRCONTION, the room is VERY SMALL, and the view was straight out to the street, walking people can look directly in the room, if curtains arent closed. That leaves you with NO VIEW.Theres NO BREAKFAST served in this room, thats due to an tiny tiny kitchen in this room i guess. Allthough there no proper diningtable avalible. And not atleast the BEDSHEETS WAS NOT CHANGED AT ALL, thats in a period of 6 nights, in the summer. The bedcarpet is a heavy thing, and wonder if this is ever washed.For a price of 135euros/night ($180/night) this hotelroom is to be reviewed as below average.This is a no go.And it has to be sayed, this is a honest review, no personal critisism of the owners of the hotel.
