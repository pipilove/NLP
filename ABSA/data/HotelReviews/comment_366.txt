Major 5 Star Hotel that just doesn't hit the mark

This is a nice, 5-star hotel in Barcelona that tries very hard but just doesn't quite hit the mark. My friend and I checked into the hotel at two separate times and had two different check-in experiences. Mine was friendly and helpful and even a glass of champagne. His was awkward, his room wasn't ready, no champagne offered and he was getting a suite while I just reserved a regular room. The hotel is large (44 stories) and modern with great views of the city of Barcelona and/or the Mediterranean Sea. The rooms are fairly large, modern and comfortable. The staff was fairly helpful although when my friend arrived by taxi he was not offered help with his two large bags and had to take them to his room by himself. We were both bothered by the housekeeping staff on more than one occassion when we had the do not disturb sign out. Its a great hotel but just doesn't quite live up to the five star reputation it has especially for the price of rooms.
