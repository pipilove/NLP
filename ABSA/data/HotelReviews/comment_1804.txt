Very satisfied

After reading other reviews before staying at The HI, I was a little concerned. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The people at The HI were extremely pleasant and helpful. The rooms were clean and neat. We faced Chinatown. The view in our room wasn't the best. It was a brick wall and the roof of another building. I didn't mind though because we really didn't spend a whole lot of time in the room and when we did, it was only to sleep. The breakfast buffet was very good but was basically the same all the time. Know that you can ask for your eggs cooked to your liking. Transportation of all kinds were close. However, I wish I had done some research before hand on how to use it. The tram was easy to use but only went in a circle and made stops up to Cockle Bay and back. If you're going to take the bus, know how they run. Make sure you know the bus #'s and where they go and how to get back. The conceirge was very helpful for that. If you like to walk, there's a lot in walking distance. Especially Paddy's Market. Good shopping!!! Expect to spend hours there. Overall I had a great experience.
