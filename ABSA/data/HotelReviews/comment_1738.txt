Excellent Hotel

We have just spent 5 nights from 13th September at this hotel as part of a vacation and this hotel was chosen as a result of the very good reviews on this site.Our stay was excellent, we arrived late at night with a confirmed booking and although we had paid the basic room rate we were allocated a room on the 24th floor with outstanding views of both Puget Sound and the Space Needle.The room was large and very comfortable and was spotlessely clean.Everyone at the hotel was extremely helpful from the checkin people to the concierge. All requests regarding sightseeing trips etc were efficiently dealt with in a friendly manner.The hotel is very well located and is near to anything of interest, we would not consider staying anywere else in Seattle.
