Pick a better spot

We stayed 2 nights at this average hotel that is priced above average. The room was pretty nice but there was nothing in the hotel beyond that- the lobby is very small with only facilities being a couple beverage despensers. The elevators were small.We didnt eat there as it was expensive.The staff was ok. It is just not anything special for 140 E excluding tax and no breakfast. Confirmation said internet facilities yet there were none.
