Just Ok

We selected the hotel because of location and we had a good rate, $139.00 per night. We stayed from Jun 30 - Jul 5.Check in was terrible. Eventhough I booked the hotel 6 months in advance and I sent an e-mail re-confirming my late arrival and my requested room (no-smoking, 2 double beds), they didn't have it and I needed to change rooms the following day. New room was clean and had a great view of the city.Parking was pricey but convenient, too many homeless in the area. If IT WASN'T FOR THE HOMELESS, the location of this hotel is very good; a minute walk from BART, cable car turn-around, muni buses, many shops. The visitor center is a block away, very convenient. Express check out was easy and fast. I think I will not stay again.
