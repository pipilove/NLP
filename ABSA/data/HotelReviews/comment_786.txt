Most unwelcoming hoteI I have been in for years

I booked this hotel through the Internet, but was very dissapointed when I got there. You do not enter the looby directly but have to get there by elevator. The whole interior and the rooms are very modern, which I usually like, but here it creates an impersonal atmosphere.I booked an expensive executive room, for a business trip, and to my surprise the room was tiny and there was a probelm with the heating which took hours to get fixed.Most unpleasant was the feeling I had there of total lack of warmth, from the staff (mostly inexperienced) and the decoration. Very unwelcoming overall.I left immediately the next morning and 1 month later I discovered they had booked my room rate twice on my credit card. I had to go through several calls and faxes before the problem was finally solved and I was re-imbursed. I will surely never go there again.
