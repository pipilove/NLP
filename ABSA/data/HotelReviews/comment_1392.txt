Don't see what the fuss is about

After reading so many positive reviews about this hotel, I booked it for my stay over the New Year. Once I arrived I was very disappointed. I'd been placed in a 'smoking allowed' room, despite requesting a non-smoking room. Asking for a room change straight away, I was refused, and was told that these requests can only be made by booking direct through Best Western's website. Therefore, I spent 4 nights in a constant tobacco smelling room  told to 'open windows'! (December in SF?!)Views? Well no, on this one too. I was facing a brick wall, with a plant pot as 'greenery'On the positive side, the bed was extremely comfortable. Location is also great, with a couple of supermarkets within a block from the hotel.
