Great short break hotel

Just returned from 5 day break staying at the Barcelona Universal Hotel with 4 friends (all over 40!) Our rooms were spotlessly clean and staff were very friendly and helpful. We loved the substantial breakfast - chocolate cheesecake for breakfast was a first!On the roof there is a VERY small pool and a few loungers for relaxing after a long day sightseeing, with fabulous views of the city. Only 10 mins walk from Ramblas though the walk there seemed to pass the edge of the red light district but a metro station outside the front door made travel easy. We got 2 day tickets for the tourist bus which covers all the main attractions and gives you a book of tickets for discounted entrance to most museums and galleries. We had a brilliant time and would definately use this hotel again. We booked through octopus travel.com and got a good deal.
