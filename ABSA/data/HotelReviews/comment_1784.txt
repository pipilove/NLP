Good Place to stay

My brother and I stayed here last year. He is going to Seattle again this year with his son. We enjoyed the stay here. Very nice place to stay. We loved the location, able to walk everywhere or take the bus. Nice walk to the market. The view on the roof top is excellent, the best! Nice to sit and relax and read or just look at the beautiful view. I do quite a bit of traveling and would recommend this place and would stay again.
