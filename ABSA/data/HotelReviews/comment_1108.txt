Great location, everything else is disappointing

The first thing to beware of with this hotel is the difference between the renovated and unrenovated/dirty rooms. The unrenovated rooms reminded me of a medieval dungeon. The unrenovated rooms have peeling paint, worn carpet and are dark/dreary. I had to ask for a renovated room. Although this was given to me, I had to pay extra for it. The renovated room was much better and well sized for a Paris hotel. However, the sheets had holes in them and some questionable stains. The service in the hotel was...unimpressive (with the exception of the bellboy). I would have switched hotels except that most of the hotels were fully booked (except in the $500 category). The best thing about this hotel is its location. It is close to the metro, the Louvre and Rue St Honore. If you don't mind some discomfort, this is the right hotel for you.
