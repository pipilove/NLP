Rude staff, stay somewhere else!

We were planning to stay at this hotel but our flight was cancelled due to a malfunction of the plane. This malfunction made us cancel our trip to the Netherlands. Every other hotel in the Netherlands agreed to refund our money, but not this one. They made no effort whatsoever to show any understanding or compassion. In fact, they were very rude and nasty to us when we tried to explain the situation to them. We even provided them with proof that our flight was cancelled and they still didn't care, they just kept saying that it is company policy. In fact, when we talked with Starwood about this policy, they actually told us that it was up to the local manager to make the determination. So, stay away from this hotel, the management is aweful and rude.
