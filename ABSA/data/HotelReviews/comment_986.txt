Beware of this Hotel

This hotel got my credit card information when the hotel I booked with couldn't get me a room and without my consent charged my credit card as I didn't show up. I have emailed but the answer is that the owner is out of town so there is nothing they can do and asked my original hotel to contact them as they were the ones that booked for me (without my authorization) and they told me they are really sorry but the hotel is not willing to reverse the charges and the only way I can get this resolved is filing a credit card fraud claim as I did not sign or give my credit information to this hotel. Be careful with your credit card information when dealing with this hotel!!!!
