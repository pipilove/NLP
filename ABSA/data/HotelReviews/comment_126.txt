Good value, excellent staff

My friend and I wanted to go to Amsterdam for a couple of days. We were looking for a 4*hotel, centrally located and The Park Hotel had a very good offer which was within our budget. We heard that the location of the hotel is the place to be as it is within minutes walk from the Leidseplein and all the musea. Very convenient! The building suits nicely in the Amsterdam architecture and the check- in was smooth and friendly. We were lucky to get one of the refurbished rooms and they looked clean and bright. The hotel has not the latest modern amenities and businesslike atmosphere like most of the airport hotels but it is definitely cosy and the staff is really friendly. After a long day of shopping (just around the corner!) we had a very tasty dinner in the typical Dutch restaurant and some drinks in the bar that gives great views. We had a fun weekend in Amsterdam and the good deal with the hotel made it a memorable experience.
