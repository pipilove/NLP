modern but lacking character

my partner and i have visited barcelona several times and to our dismay found ourselves in a very modern hotel. very clean , staff friendly , but lacking any atmosphere. very buisness like with a mixture of suits and students. the pool was very small and along with the very small bar seating area we spent most of our time wandering around barcelona which was a shame because we were actually looking for a relaxing lie around as in the the past we have never had a hotel in barcelona with a pool. many couples at night when returning to the hotel went to there rooms for a half an hour and then returned to the bar area when seats were available. i cannot complain as such about this hotel but it states roof pool and i can only say if there were more than 4 people in the pool at once you may have bodily contact with strangers. but i suppose there might be a seat spare in the bar for a beverage.
