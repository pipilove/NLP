lovely hotel

Stayed at the hotel for 4 nights, Feb 25th to 29th. did not arrive until after midnight but this was no problem. Reception staff were very helpful and friendly throughout our stay and they all spoke good English. we did not have breakfast at the hotel but there are plenty of cafes and restaurants nearby. Hotel very centrally located right beside the Pantheon. Rooms were small but very comfortable and cleaned every day. No complaints about hotel and would definitely stay here again. One word of warning, be careful of pickpockets, especailly young girls aged 11 or 12, on the Paris underground. They are very professional and your purse could be gone from your bag in a matter of seconds!
