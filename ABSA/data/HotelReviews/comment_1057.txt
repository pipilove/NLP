Good value, comfortable and clean, very nice staff, good location.

Excellent rating not because hotel was fancy, but because staff was very nice and helpful, the hotel felt clean and safe, and it is a great location for visiting all of central Paris. We could walk to Louvre in 5 min, Opera 5 min, D' Orssay in 15 min, Saint Germain 20 minutes, Everything was a 10 Euro or less Cab fare.Thank you, too Moon (SP?) at the front desk who made our stay extra special. Thanks also to the front desk gentleman at night, who helped us arrange an extra nights stay when we were mistreated at another hotel. My girfreind and I have visited Paris several times and stayed in a number of hotels. This hotel is a good basic choice if you you just want a clean, safe place from which to visit the sites. If you want a fancy lobby and lounge it's a 5-10 minute walk to the Ritz or the Westin.Be careful not to confuse this hotel with two others with a similair name.
