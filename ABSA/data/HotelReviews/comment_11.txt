Sheraton Pulitzer 4* but not 5

We just stay in Amsterdam this week end. It was my 5th visit in Amsterdam but my frist stay at the Pulitzer. Thanks I got a special price endless week end wich make the price for the room at 215 Euros the night. It was a Deluxe room (normal rate 450 Euros). Thanks I did not have to pay this price !! room was OK but the bathroom is so tiny that 2 people could not move. No hairdryer !!! I you want a canal view they charge you 30 Euros per night (which was not mentioned in the Starwood hotel reservation). Anyway. Location is nice, bar is nice, staff friendly but I'd rather put my money in another hotel next time. However, people should know that the rating in Amsterdam is different. I have experienced Renaissance Amsterdam and I was very disappointed.
