The Altamont Hotel

First impressions of hotel: A small old hotel now chain-owned. Rooms: Terrible. Ancient furniture and TV. Filthy. Bathroom had smeared tiles. We didn't look forward to returning to our rooms at night after a day of touring.Beds: Okay. Went to the liquor store, made a few drinks and slept well. Breakfast: Almost nothing. Service: Average. Location: Didn't work for us. Too far away from everything. Verdict: Unless it was a very very good deal, we would not go here again.
