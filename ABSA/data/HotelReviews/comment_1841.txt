Great hotel in a great location

We should mention we booked this hotel through Priceline, which gave us a fabulous deal of $150/night when regular rooms went for $300/night. But while our rave review may be slightly enhanced due to our bargain, I would still consider it a solid hotel choice even at full price.The hotel definitely seems more geared towards business travelers, but the location itself proves great for tourists and leisure travelers as well. It is located only a short walk from The Rocks and Opera House, as well as the ferries in the Quay. The concierge was very helpful without being snooty (as some concierges are nowadays) and gave us some great restaurant recommendations (including one where I was inches away from David Beckham....but that's a different story). We tried the breakfast buffet, which was a bit pricey at $33/pp but was filling and had all the standard offerings.One note of advice - check the taxi rates before coming! I had looked at the Marriott website and it said a cab ride from the airport was only $35. Our cab ride ended up being $61 and we just thought the website was outdated. Later on, we asked the concierge about it and they said that we were definitely overcharged, and that their bellman should have noticed the price and had us refuse to pay. I don't blame the bellman because he was very busy getting our luggage into the hotel, but just know there are cab drivers out there that will screw you - if you know the right fare ahead of time, you will be better prepared to dispute it.
