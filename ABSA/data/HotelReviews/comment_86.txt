return every year

We have stayed here 3 times over the last 3 Christmases and enjoyed each stay in 3 totally different rooms. Love the location, easy to walk to anywhere and close to some wonderful restaurants and bars. Bar in the hotel is expensive but what hotel bar isn't? and we have paid more for a drink in the Waldorf Astoria New York....I smoke so I can't say that the cigarette smoking bothered me, however, I do think that if you are particularly anti-smoking then Amsterdam (and similarly Prague) are not the cities for you, there are many, many other cities you can go to in this world where it is banned totally.
