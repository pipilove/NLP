Overpriced-Indifferent-Questionable 4 star rating

We stayed here for three nights, having booked through a well-known German tour operator. I sent a confirmation email to the hotel three days prior to our arrival, which went unanswered. This turned out to be indicative of our Hotel Terrass experience. I rang the night before our departure from Germany and was informed that a room with a bath would be no problem. When we arrived, we were checked in with a minimum of attention. The room we were given did not have a bath, and having requested a room with a view, I was a little diappointed to have the room look over a back yard. We moved rooms. This room had no bedside table, a TINY wardrobe, no lock on either the room door or the bathroom door and was VERY small, even by Parisian standards for the daily charge in excess of 250 EUR. The room (506 - to be avoided) was extremely warm - I think a boiler was located behind one of the partition walls between us and the adjoining room. Air conditioning filled the room with a dank and musty smell. The bath was also very small, with one end located under the sink unit. The TV remote did not work and the view bill on tv function, which the hotel curiously advertises as one of the room's features did not work. Breakfast was standard and overpriced. Complaints to staff fell on deaf and indifferent ears. In fact, indifference sums up the staff's attitude rather well. Having read all the positive reviews, we were looking forward to staying here but by the end of our trip, I felt well and truly cheated. Last year, we spent 99 EUR a night, stayed in the St. Germain area and enjoyed our stay greatly in a bigger room, more central location and a hotel staffed by friendly and helpful Parisians. How this hotel boasts four stars is truly beyond me. I would advise against staying here unless you are opting for a suite and have minimal service expectations.
