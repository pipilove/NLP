Great Relaxing Time

I happened to stay at this boutique hotel in sydney, the Altamont in Darlinghurst...the host and staff went out of their way to make me feel more than comfortable...my demands were met with courtesy and attention and nothing seemed to be to much of a problem...a very enjoyable six days of accommodation...a big thank you to all at the Altamont
