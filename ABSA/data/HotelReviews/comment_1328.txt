Cute but Tiny

The hotel looks great from the outside, and the lobby and other decor is probably the best on this waterfront. Go here for a drink or the free wine tasting they have every afternoon. Staying here is another story, we booked in advance direct (paid top) and when we got there were given most probably the smallest room for 2 nights.They told us they were fully booked, but we saw vacant rooms on the way to our allocated (so mis timing from house keeping to reception was noted). Spoke to house keeping to confirm other rooms were available and asked the head of house keeping to let reception know, they did and managed to change our room the next day (no apology). I paid hundreds of dollars for my stay here and the first day was spoiled by them because we were shuffed in the basement matchbox room. It all smiley and nice.They tried it on - I winged and got a better room.Also had a massage at the other hotel who this hotel concierge can arrange, (was a gift for my misses) the massage cost us $310 (inc tips) and was pitter patter touching (if you need the name for the massage place to avoid let me know). Another client cancelled as we walked out (in a huff) as they ran 20 minutes late.If you like a winge for your high rate stay here.They give you yoga mats, my misses liked that.Photo's are of room before and room after winge.
