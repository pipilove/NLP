Excellent location and value, helpful staff.

Recommended. For about Aus$180 a night (aboutæ‹¢80 sterling)the Holiday Inn, Darling Harbour is excellent value for money. It's pretty functional, certainly not luxurious but the rooms are large, bathrooms very good and the location (within China Town) ideal for eating out (the Szeuchan restaurant immediately behind the hotel is outstanding). Darling Harbour is a very pleasant five minute walk away.Staff could not have been more helpful, responding flexibly when our backpacking daughter arrived to stay with us. We were upgraded to a double Queen room without charge.
