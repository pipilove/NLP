Wasn't my cup of tea

The decor was cool, the pictures just like on the website, but overall it was my least favorite hotel of the five we stayed in Europe. It was too small, perhaps, because I felt somewhat isolated, there was almost never anyone else in the small public spaces. Some of the front desk people had some trouble understanding us, and us them and I felt a resentful attitude asking for things like ice or extra towels. I suppose the last straw was the morning we left, with a cab waiting to take us to the train station at 7 a.m. , we were asked to pay our laundry bill in cash, that it could not be put on our credit card and to my horror (and own fault for not better checking prices) the $274 euros for about 20 items, mostly baby clothes. It left a bad taste in my mouth when my husband and the desk people argued about why we couldn't put it on a credit card. They wanted us to go to an ATM but we didn't have time. It's a cute hotel, but I wouldn't stay again.
