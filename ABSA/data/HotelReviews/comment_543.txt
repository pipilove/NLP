Not quite as good...

As an enthusiastic user of members' recommendations, we were expecting great things of the Jazz Hotel. Sadly, it did not live up to the earlier rave reviews.It's a good hotel with lovely modern rooms, including a well designed bathroom. The hotel is ideally situated in the centre of the City, close to the Metro (which you can hear on the lower floors but it doesn't disturb your sleep).What let it down from a 5 star review was:1. The fridge didn't work and it couldn't be fixed2. The hot water system broke down on our final night so we couldn't shower before we left. The receptionist made no reference or an apology when we checked out.3. The barman (in the very small but attractive bar) kept disappearing for over 10 minutes. This led to some other guests to help themselves!4. Some receptionists were very helpful but others couldn't be bothered.Overall, I'd still recommend the hotel but, based on our 3 day stay, I'd say it doesn't deserve to be in the top 3.
