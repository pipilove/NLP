Let's get the good stuff out there:Location: SuperbCommunal areas: these make the hotel, they are old-fashioned but very cosy and you'll happily sit in the library reading the papers if you so desire.Service: helpful and friendlyHowever, I always look forward to two things when I go to a hotel, and they are a great room and a delicious breakfast. Breakfast was distinctly average, not a very wide choice. And the standard room was tiny. I KNOW this is standard for city-centre hotels, especially in a canal-house, but there was no floorspace even for our bags! We had to move chairs to get the wardrobe open, there was nothing in the mini-bar, the bed mattress was AWFUL and shower room was a different climate to the rest of the room, seemingly being located somewhere near the North Pole.Whilst I wouldn't put anyone off staying here as the prices are reasonable, it's not somewhere I would return simply because getting a good night's sleep is so hard.
