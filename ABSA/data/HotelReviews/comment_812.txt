Excellent property

Like many other reviews listed here for this property, the Berlin Marriott actually exceeded my expectations. The building is only 3 years old and actually sits in the eastern sector of the city. Our room was appointed very nicely and everything was in perfect working order. Those of you lucky enough to gain access to the Executive Lounge will find it to be one of the finest , if not the best, in the Marriott system. The breakfast offerings were incredible as were the evening snacks, which turned out to be enough for dinner. The lounge also offers free internet service through the use of 3 PC's. The staff in the lounge work very hard and seemed to appreciate the the 2 Euros I left for them each day.The location of this hotel is nothing short of outstanding. Directly above the subway, across the street from the Sony Center (an entertainment area) and about 3 blocks from the Brandenberg Gate and Holocaust memorial.The staff were very helpful and went out of their way. I didn't find a single surly employee. Dinner in the restaurant was excellent as well.The Marriott site estimates taxi fare from the airport to be 18 Euros and that's exactly what it cost. I would not recommend taking the subway from the airport because it first requires getting on a city bus which then takes you to a subway stop. The taxi ride to the main railway station took approximately 6 minutes and costed just a few Euros.Should I ever find myself back in Berlin, this would be the only establishment I'd check into.
