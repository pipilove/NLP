very snooty

Don't stay here if you can get a room at the Eiffel Tower Hilton. The quality of staff here can in no way compare to the staff at the Eiffel Tower Hilton. And the room was dirty and small. The wait staff in the Executive Lounge would openly make fun of the guests with one another. I saw them pointing and laughing at one middle-aged woman because of the orthopedic shoes she had on and they did this right in front of her! And the doormen were only interested in helping the Sheik and his party. I guess this is how the French have gotten their reputation for snootiness. I won't stay here again if I can help it.
