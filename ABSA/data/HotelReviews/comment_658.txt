Noisy and a bit run-down

I may be too crititical, but I found this hotel quite bad. The rooms are kept clean , but since the hotel is quite old, it doesn't have a very clean look. Staff was not especially friendly, I have seen better. They were not unfriendly either, they just didn't seem to care much. Breakfast was tasteless. But the worst thing was the indoor noise. I had asked for a quiet room. From 8 o' clock on it was just a banging of doors and throwing things around in the hallway. Roomcleaning takes place in as loud a fashion as possible. And since the hotel needs renovation, it all seems to happen right next to you. Another thing is that the cleaning lady just walked into my room on the morning of my last day. She totally ignored the do-not-disturb sign and just walked in immediately after knocking. I was still in bed! That just topped it off. I was so relieved to leave this place.
