Great little budget gem

More than adequate for the price, especially in San Francisco. Clean, comfortable, and spacious with helpful and friendly staff. Bathroom was cold when showering because the fan runs all the time. Did not find it noisy (had requested upstairs room, as per tripadvisor advice). Great diner for breakfast around the corner if continental is not enough for you.
