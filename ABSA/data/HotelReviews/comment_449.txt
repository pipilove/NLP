Bang On

Stayed July 13 to15 2005. The staff especially SARA were very helpful by recommending tapas bars and resturants as well as going over the maps they gave us on tourist sites,The room was right on Las Ramblas and when you closed the sliding doors it was very quiet. The bathroom had a large jacuzzi tub with robes and slippers.The bed was top notch, and the room very clean and tastefully decorated.Icannot believe this is a three star hotel,Ihave stayed ingood4 and 5 star hotels that do not even come close to this.The price is very good for the quality you get. Just keepdoing what your doing well done
