That Was Then, This Is Now....

I guess I just don't have the proper appreciation for the difficulty in joining 20 odd canal houses together to make a hotel. Or maybe it was just my expectations of what I would find in the way of a five star property. But in any event, I was underwhelmed with the Pulitzer. Not that it's a bad hotel. It's just not 'Luxury Collection' material. The room I had was very large for Amsterdam. In fact, there are many apartments that are considerably smaller (okay, so I peeked in the windows of way too many apartments as I walked along the canals). The bathroom was nice (big tub, heated marble floors), hotel room was relatively quiet, and the staff was very friendly, though a bit lacking in their knowledge of restaurants. The place is just very disjointed. No central lobby to speak of. Horrible art. I mean awful. You have to jig and jog (and jig and jog) to get to the only bar/restaurant (both of which are nice/just okay). And heaven help if you need to go to the bathroom while at the bar/restaurant (over the river and through the woods, to grandmother's house we go...). Would definitely stay here again, but only if I get a very good deal. Starwood?? Are you listening??
