Disappointing hotel - not recommended

It is an anomaly that this hotel is rated so highly - and not because of any random and easily repairable bad experience (such as poor service or bad meals). My low rating stems from fundamental systematic errors in this hotel including:* Appalling in room television/radio/technology. There was an old, small, black, CRT television. The channel selection was minimal, picture quality average, and inroom movie options unimpressive. It was the position of the television which was the most disappointing. A hotel room (distinguished from a suite or apartment) should have the television placed in the corner of the room or immediately in front of the bed - not in a wardrobe, on a high shelf, to the left of the bed.* Bed and pillows uncomfortable.These are not small problems because they both combine to consume more than 80% of one's time in the hotel. Yes the hotel was clean, yes the service was good, yes the bathroom was fantastic. But all of that is insignificant when compared to bed and television facilities.I would not recommend this hotel and will not be staying there again.
