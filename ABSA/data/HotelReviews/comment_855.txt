Children Controlling the Business Centre Computers

Great location and fantastic breakfast (man媒 reviews said to skip this but we found the hotel to have a comprehensive offering). Two problems: computer access and TV channel choices. There is no CNN or BBC offering so that there is really no way you can be in touch with the news if you don't speak German. While the hotel is kind enough to offer 2 computers in their business centre, this centre is in the lobby next to the kiddie area. The polic媒 of the hotel is for persons over the age of 16 to use the computer, but every time one goes down to the computer area there are children under this age on the two computers. Finally you may get a computer, but don't be surprised if some kids show up and start harrasing you to get off the computer. It is an outrageous situation that I have not experienced anywhere in the world. The hotel should give a password out to guests that check-in or at least program a time-out to avoid this frustrating situation.
