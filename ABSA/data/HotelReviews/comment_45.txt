Great hotel

I travel to Amsterdam frequently on business and have stayed in many hotels in the city. I like the Estherea very much - lovely location, quality of the rooms is superb and the cost of the hotel not so extortionate. There is a great Greek deli just next to the hotel if you are looking for a simple casual evening meal - perfect for a lone traveller like me! My only complaint is that breakfast starts at 7am - it would be nice if it could start a little earlier. The hotel is a brisk 10 min walk to Central Station - along the lovely canal, what is not to like? Highly recommended.
