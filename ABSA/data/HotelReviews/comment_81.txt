Excellent Location

We stayed at this hotel for our wedding anniversary. I booked two months in advance and requested a room with a view. We did not get a view unfortunately however we were upgraded to an executive room which was really great, lovely clean room with everything in that we might need - even bath robes and slippers!The hallways smelt musty and the decor in the main part of the hotel does need updating.The bar prices and hotel restaurant are all quite expensive but then that is to be expected in a four star hotel in the centre of a european city. I think this hotel is supposed to be a five star but I don't feel that it is. The facilities are really good but it is missing the luxury feel of a five star hotel. As other reviews have stated the hotel does need some redecoration and the bedding and curtains could do with a splash of colour. That said the room was really nice and clean, the staff friendly and helpful, the in room safe was free and there was also free tea/coffee in our room. All in all we had a great time here and would come again - that is when we have saved up enough !!!!!!!
