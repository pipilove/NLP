Expensive Dump

This is NOT a five star hotel! It is a tired, run down dump. Quality of finishes, fittings and furniture is of a Travel Lodge in the UK......which is a very tight budget hotel. Public areas are very grubby and needing paint, new carpet and general good cleaning......we faced a long queue at check in but only one person working. Room seemed unfinished, but to be fair, both room and bathroom were clean. Location right in the centre of tourist tat, kebab shops and pizza joints....but only a short walk to real Amsterdam. Would NOT stay here again. Ever!
