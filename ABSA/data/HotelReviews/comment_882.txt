Better hotels in Berlin than the Concorde

I stayed a weekend in Hotel Concorde in middle of August. I booked this hotel as it was said to have the most spacious rooms in Berlin. I could not believe that the de luxe rooms really had 50 square meter. Because of all the wood and the outlay of rooms, rooms seem much smaller. Staff at reception is not friendly - more on the side of efficient - how can you enjoy your stay if you are not welcome. This seems a perfect hotel for businesspeople or groups but not for individuals. Although the architecture is phantastic, this hotel is not my No 1 choice - undoubtedly this is the Hotel de Rome. There are much nicer hotels for the money in Berlin! And Kurfçœ‰rstendamm is not the No 1 location, this is Gendarmenmarkt. Here are a lot of hotels and mostly better. I would not go there again!
