Great hotel service but with few flaws

My wife and I spent 3 nights at the Palace Hotel in Berlin. The location of the hotel is right on Kurf眉rstendamm and very close to the Zoo and Ged盲nknich kirsche.We stayed in one of the renovated rooms after recommendation from Tripadvisor. This was a good recommendation. We had a direct view over the zoo and to the Fernsehturm. The room is modern and has a good size. The beds are rather hard. The hotel has a high standard: There is a good pianoplayer in the bar area at night.The service from the staff is more than excellent. They certainly live up to the standard of The leading hotels of the world. The only minus is the additional costs. Internet Connection is rated to 22 Euros per night which is very high. The prices in the bar are approx. 50% more expensive than in a restaurant. The pool area is fantastic but the pool was rather cold and we therefore only used it once. You have to pay to use the sauna area.
