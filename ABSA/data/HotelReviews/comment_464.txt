Top Class Hotel

My Hubby and I stayed at the hotel 24-27th Sept for the first leg of our Honey Moon, and what a delight. We were upgraded to a Junior Suite with Champers  Chocolates. Our room was cleaned daily with a turn down service every evening. The location was excellent with a 5 min stroll to La Ramblas. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, it can be pricie, but well worth it. Definately worth it's 5 Stars.
