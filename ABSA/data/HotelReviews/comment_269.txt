Nice - in an excellent loaction

Me and my friends went for a 3 nights stay in Amsterdam. We had all different bookings, from the smalles room to the suite. The check-in whas quick with plenty of staff in the reception. I had the smallest room. The room whas nice, functional with a good bed - but perhaps a little crowded for 2 people. The bathroom was all tiles, and with good waterpressure, even beeing on the top floor.Excellent for business, or for staying over weekends.
