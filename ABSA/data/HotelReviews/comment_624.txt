Absolutely terrible

My husband and I stayed at the Westin for three nights. We had booked a non-smoking room but were given a smoking room instead. Our room was down a long corridor with three dead lightbulbs, which we pointed out but were not replaced during our stay. As soon as I arrived I went to wash my hands and I the head of the tap came off. The fridge door became unhinged as soon as I opened it. This would have been funny were it not because we were on a rare break and, in addition, the room was tired, smelly, had a stained carpet and a stained armchair. The net curtains had not seen a washer in a long while. The sheets were not changed for three days and one the them had a suspicious rosy mark on it. However, the worst thing was the level of service (or rather the complete lack of it). We were not given another room and had to wait until the next day for the tap and fridge to be fixed. I asked for the sheets to be changed three times and I was told they would be, but it never happened. Reception staff were plain rude and even the manager told me (I still can't believe I heard this) that they had given us a smoking room, even if I had asked for a NS one because I happen to be Spanish and most Spanish people smoke! We tried the pool to relax ouserselves but after waiting for 15 mins to get some towels we gave up (a single lady was managing the beauty centre and the whole pool area). The following day we were lucky with the towels, but found the poolside furniture dirty, We were never given any apologies or signs of regret for the shortcomings we had to deal with. A frustrating and depressing experience. I had to pinch myself to believe it was actually happening.
