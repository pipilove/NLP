Do not accept to move to Expo Hotel !!!

Well...I should start by the booking process...Booked a night through a last minute website. Booking was confirmed at the hotel. Surprise arriving at the Hotel.. As many other messages , hotel claims that Torre Catalunya is overbooked and we should move to sister Hotel next door , EXPO HOTEL. Simply have a look on the review of Expo Hotel ( which I did before coming ) and see the difference. I said to the recepcionist that this was not negotiable , that I had a booking there , and would stay there.She went 3 times to see the manager , and at the end.. Magic..A room appear to me and my 5 years old son. Not a room..a choice of smoking , no smoking , doubles , twins..etc..I am a Hotel owner , and the strategy is simple. Sell the Hotel Torre with inviting promotions and last minute prices , and place guests at the next door hotel.Their ratings are bad , so people will be more tempted to try Torre. Once guests arrive at the reception , they try to put you next door. The Torre hotel is nice , modern and trendy. Although some lack of details on the room. The amenities choice are the poorest I have seen in a hotel 4*. On the bathroom , there is a telephone , which is chic and nice. But what is the point having a phone where the phone cable measures 25 feet... Yes , that amount of cable hanging beside the bowl and the bidet !!!And 2 wholes on the middle of the marble on the shower area..We were on the 3rd floor...facing the station...noisy...very noisy..So bad sound proofing there..Views of breakfast are breathtaking , but the buffet choice is not from a 4*....Again , it is nice , but not for the hotel classification. I pai a promotional price of 150 euros for the night...Normal price would be 200 euros... To be honest...expensive..Above all...DO NOT ACCEPT GOING NEXT DOOR..FIRST : BAD RATINGSSECOND : NOT SAME QUALITYTHIRD : SHOULD NOT BE THE SAME PRICE FOUR : IT IS AN ATTEMP TO FOOL PEOPLE
