Plumbing Problems

Just returned from a two night stay celebrating our 25th anniversary. The hotel was beautiful, the room was exquisite, the small touches were well thought out.I didn't expect plumbing problems though from a luxury hotel. We were watching a movie in the room when we heard a strange noise. Upon investigation, it was water bubbling up through the shower drain. We hadn't showered yet as it was still early evening.We called maintenance who said there was no problem. I told him it was not hygenic but his response was that it wasn't toilet water. Toilet water or not, I would have at least expected the evening maid to disinfect the shower. She was already there when the maintance man came. She didn't clean the shower.I found that disgusting and unsanitary. I didn't use the shower again.I won't return there!
