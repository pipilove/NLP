A four star hotel? Haha...

My boyfriend and I booked this hotel for one night using expedia. We thought it would be a fabulous night in a four star hotel. A treat really. HA! What a joke.From the moment we walked into the hotel there was nothing but trouble. The room we requested was not even a possibility when we got there (even though it was posted on expedia).The towels were no bigger than a face cloth, the sheets were too short for the bed, so our feet touched the matress. When we requested proper bedding -we were questioned, no sorry, interegated before they would send someone up.The concierge knew nothing about the city. And the managers kept passing the buck as to 'who's fault all the problems fell to'.They gave us no compensation for our troubles...oops...except for a bag of about 15 covered nuts. HA...What a ridiculous experience for the over $350 we spent on the tackiest room I've ever seen.Oh ya'...don't forget to check out the leapord print old robes. That's a site.A terrible experience...just terrible.
