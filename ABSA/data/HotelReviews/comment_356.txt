Don't Do it - Not worth it

Hotel has problems: Some uncleanliness, elevator problems, staff not helpful, but most of all not safe to leave hotel. There is only one entrance to enter hotel so makes it diffifult to enter or leave. Reason for this is theives and streetwalkers outside. No police to be seen at all outside. Had a sales conference here and had 6 thefts on street or room Professional thieves throughout the city. Be afraid or don't come.
