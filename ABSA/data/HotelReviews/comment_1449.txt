Just ok, Front Desk needs retraining

Requested a high corner room in February through the hotel website for my August trip to San Francisco. Front desk was unaccomodating upon check in. Checked with them every day of my six night stay and they were not able to honor my request. Staff with few exceptions seems cold and unapologetic. Location A+ (get the muti-day Muni pass)Staff D- Customer service training neededRoom C- Clean but Average, AC did not work properly in room, bed ok but not wonderful, three oversized pillows uselessExtras C - Business center will let your print a boarding pass for your return trip for free, anything else costs per page with internet access $10.00 for 20 minutesOverall C- Location is the key with this property. Service is lacking and upgrades bring them to about the year 2000. Not impressed and will stay elsewhere next time.
