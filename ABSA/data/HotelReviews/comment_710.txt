Nightmare Awful.

Located in the old East Berlin amongst abandoned and/or decrepit apartment buildings. No cafes or shops within safe walking distance. First room smelt of urine and cigarettes, asked to be moved to luke-warm reception. Was on the 8th floor, but very, very noisy. Felt unsafe, was so happy to check out and get to Hamburg!
