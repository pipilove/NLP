Spent three nights last week

We had an inside room, facing onto the courtyard. The room was small, but it was mostly due to the king-sized bed and some rather large pieces of furniture that were in the room. The bed was really comfortable. The staff was very friendly and attentive. We drove, so that was a disadvantage as we chose to valet our car for the unlimited in and out privileges. I thought it was pretty pricey at $29.00 per night plus tax. The best feature of this hotel is location, location, location. We loved that we could easily stroll all of Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39 and North Beach. We'll likely stay here again.
