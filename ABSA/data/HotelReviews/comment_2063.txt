Fab and conveniently located Sydney hotel

This hotel is fab! Highly recommended! You get a very friendly, efficient welcome, every staff member I met was helpful and professional. Its in a nice residential part of Sydney, incredibly central yet not on a majorly busy city road (15-20mins walk to heart of city, harbours, museums). The room I stayed in had glass patio doors with a little outdoor space with large container plants, a huge and comfortable bed, powerful shower in big bathroom, with fridge and air con, hair dryer etc. It was spotlessly cleaned daily (- except when I said not to worry in order to do my bit on an environmental level!) It has a bar, and more fun - a huge roof terrace! (Good to be able to have a fag for all us terrible smokers!) I was given a good deal pricewise because I stayed 11 days. Its also got character, not a bland modern hotel, but you feel that care has been taken to furnishthe public areas with old bits and pieces. For art lovers its practically next door to one of the best places to buy Aboriginal artwork too, and very near to a great 50 yr old coffee house called Coluzzo's!
