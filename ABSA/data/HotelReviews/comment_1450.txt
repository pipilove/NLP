Plain Vanilla, Overated

The room itself was OK, but here are the downsides: typical deceptive pricing: get them in the door with a cheap quote, and then charge extra once you got them: Internet (per computer) $5 Aquafina water, $50 per night parking (the attendant lied at check-in about neighboring options. Unfriendly service at check-in and concierge desk. Just completely uninspired. OK value, if you expect 3 star hotel in good location.
