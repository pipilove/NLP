Cheerful welcome and a nice stay

My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Fita for one night on a weekend trip to Amsterdam to see Boom Chicago. I had read some favorable reviews online and found that the hotel was very close to the Leidseplein where the theatre is located. The young woman who checked us in was friendly and cheerful. She immediately announced that we were getting an upgrade to the largest (A) type room in the hotel. (It was probably because the hotel was not full, but we thought it was a very nice gesture!) After we settled in our room, she appeared with 2 glasses of champagne. A very nice start to our weekend in Amsterdam.The room was very clean, nicely decorated, with a large spotless bathroom. When we returned to the hotel that night, our room key card opened the front door to the lobby. Breakfast was quite nice, but not as elaborate and extensive as what had been described in other reviews. It was fine, though, again with pleasant service.I have already recommended the Hotel Fita to a friend, and we will definitely return the next time we take trip to Amsterdam.
