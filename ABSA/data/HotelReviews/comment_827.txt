Good Hotel

We stayed at the Agon for 3 nights in March 2007. The hotel was very clean with friendly staff and a good breakfast. The surrounding area does have a lot of graffiti but we felt very safe and as the U5 Samariterstrasse train station is only 200m away, the hotel becomes very convenient to get around Berlin. I would recommend obtaining the Berlin Welcome Card (areas ABC), which gives unlimited use of the trains, buses, trams and discounts to most tourist sites including Potsdam. Use the 100 or 200 bus which takes you around most of the tourist sites in Mitte. We followed a previous recommendation on Trip Advisor and ate at the La Palma Italian restaurant which is approx 200m away from the hotel (turn left then left again across the traffic lights then up on the left), the food was excellent. I would highly recommend Berlin and this hotel for a short break.
