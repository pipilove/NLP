Pretty Well Flawless Hotel

Stayed for 2 nights in corner suite. Arrived at 9 am and room was available by 11 am, checkin was swift and painless. Room was extremely comfortable, clean, and well prepared. Ate in the Char Restaurant that evening, almost empty but the food and service was excellent - during the next 36 hours used the hotel as a base for touring Sydney and for the price it was exceptional value and superb location, although the view from rooms is not the best (if this worries you pay an extra $100+ per night). Only real negative was the barman in the hotel bar, somewhat brusque and didnt have a clue about preparing a decent gin and tomic with ice and lemon! Rest of staff were as good as ever, which is why I will be returning to this hotel at least once per month on business and holiday trips to Sydney - it is exceptional value for my company's money!
