doesn't deserve 3rd place

Hotel Jazz has a great location to Las Ramblas and Bus Touristica. The rooms were good sized, perfectly cleaned,and with very nice toiletries. There was a very nice and empty lounge on the 1st floor with free internet service with two computer stations. I thought the beds were hard but comfortable. We were a large group and had one double (2 twins together) and one junior suite with one double and a queen sofa sleeper. The children were disappointed that the pool was closed, but it is never heated anyway. The maid service was the best! Better than any luxury hotel I have ever stayed at.the Consthe front staff needs to learn how to give directions, provide suggestions for restaraunts and entertainment, and be nice. If you have been to Barcelona and know how to get around-this is a great hotel. If you are new to the area, I would not recommend it. It is hard to find, taxi drivers never know how to find it and if they make a booking for you- they probably receive an incentive. On one incident, i made my own booking, I believe the staff was not happy, so he sent me to the wrong address. I plan to visit barcelona often so right now I have nothing to compare it with. But thereare many choices to choose from.
