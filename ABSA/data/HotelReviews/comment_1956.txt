Overpriced, but nice.

We stayed at the Swissotel for four nights on our honeymoon in late September 2007. The hotel is very nice - the public spaces are beautiful, the workout room is very nice, and pool is great. The rooms are nice, but please be forewarned: The beds are as hard as a rock. I would honestly say that the bed was the least comfortable hotel bed that I have ever slept in. The view from our room was great - we looked out over the Sydney tower and one of the city's many parks. We tried the breakfast buffet one morning - it was grossly overpriced. The quality was average, but the price was anything but average. I would skip the restaurant and the bar and find places that are a better value. (Actually, the food court next to the hotel has a great place for freshly squeezed fruit juice and there is another stand with decent muffins/breakfast breads.)
