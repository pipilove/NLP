Basic but good enough

The hotel is a fair distance from the city centre but very close to Hyde Park. The hotel provides a basic service. Breakfast is the only meal served and guests are encouraged to eat out or order take-away [directory provided in the room of various restaurants]. Each room has a microwave, kitchen area and laundry rooms are available on various floors. So it is very much a self-serve hotel. In general the hotel is clean and rooms are cleaned daily.
