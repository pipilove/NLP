Overated Hotel

The Hotel Arts has wonderful installations and superb rooms. The concierge was consistently helpful. The rest of the service however was truly dismal. We waited 1h30 to be served a salad at Bites, the waitress was resentful at our asking the reason for the delay. The quality of food procured from room service was poor. After having reported plumbing problems daily for 4 consecutive days, no attempt had been made to resolve the matter; the receptionists did not appear concerned that no attention had been paid to our requests. In general this hotel seems to live on its past reputation, one that no longer deserves.
