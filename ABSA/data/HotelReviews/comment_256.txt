Excellent Excellent Excellent!!!

We have just arrived from a business trip to Amsterdam. We paid for a Superior Room but they gave us a Junior Suite because it was our first time to Amsterdam (at least that's what they said). The location was excellent and no taxi was needed since everything was in walking distance from the hotel. The room was luxury with oversized bathroom and a huge bed but very clean above all. Our bedroom was overlooking the Dam Square. Every single staff was friendly and always willing to help you. Swissotel is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. I would definetely go again!
