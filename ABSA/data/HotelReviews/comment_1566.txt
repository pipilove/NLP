Avoid until construction/refurbishment is completed

I stayed at the Sheraton in Seattle one day before a cruise. The hotel is in a perfect location to walk to many downtown restaurants and shops. The hotel is under construction so the entrance is poorly marked on the side side of the hotel. The taxi driver could not pull up to the curb due to construction materials in the street. There was no one there to help me with my luggage and no ramp up from the street. Only after I made it to the lobby was I offered help with the luggage. Too late! Check in was a breeze, less than 5 minutes. There are two sets of elevators depending on which floor you are on and I was directed to the wrong set. Fortunately I caught the error before getting on. The room was clean and standard but outdated in shades of buff and yellow. There is no gift/sundry shop due to the construction and the restaurant/bar is just a cordoned off section of the lobby.I might try the Seattle Sheraton after the construction and refurbishment is finished but not before then. Even thought I secured what I felt was a very reasonable rate on Hotwire I do not feel the hotel was worth the price.
