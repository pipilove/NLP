Very disappointing - overpriced!

Went to the Banks Mansion for two nights in April. Went with my brother so we booked two rooms. Hotel looks great from the outside but extremely disappointing inside. It looks as though it has been designed with the cheapest of everything possible. It is certainly not a boutique hotel and infact nothing more than a rather poor bed and breakfast. My room was at the back of the hotel. Woodchip celings and two very small windows that I hd to stand on my tip toes to see out. The furniture in the rooms is of chipboard quality and the complimentary mini bar - well laughable. They advertise that all your drinks are free, yes they are if you want to drink cheap Cava, cheap white wine and cheap red wine. You cannot get spirits in the downstairs bar! The staff are very abrupt and the breakfast room is in the basement of the hotel and is reminiscent of a school lunch room. There is no restaurant facilities in the hotel at other times. I would not recommend it to couples for a romantic weekend - it isn't romantic. I think they have some clever marketing but surely they cannot continue to kid everyone all the time.It may be good value if you can drink 48 bottles of beer a day - I sadly couldn't!
