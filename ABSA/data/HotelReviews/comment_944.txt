Great Central Location

My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for a week at the end of May. We appreciated the proximity to the St Michel metro stop -- we were able to take the RER directly to and from CDG without station changes or long walks. The rooms are small, which is fairly normal in Paris. The windows are double-glazed and block out sound from the Latin Quarter extremely well. They also swing open so you can bring in the street sounds and fresh air when you'd like. Very clean, nice accommodations. The bathroom was two separate rooms -- one for the toilet and one for the sink and shower. There was no bidet. The shower was fantastic, good pressure, roomy. The front desk staff were always very pleasant. They were quite crisp on occasion but we do not need much help and did not mind at all.
