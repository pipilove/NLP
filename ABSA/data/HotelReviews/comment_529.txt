Great Location

This is a stylish modern contemporary hotel in a great location. The rooms are spacious, comfortable and great value. The bathrooms are tasteful and luxurious.The roof top pool was great (if a little cold in May!)The bar is trendy and we had great service. I didn't make it up for breakfast either day (this was down the to the great night life) so cannot comment on the food.All in all our 2 night stay at the Jazz Hotel was fab and if I was ever to return to Barcelona I would def book the Hotel Jazz!Hope this helpsxx
