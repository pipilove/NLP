Yuck

Disappointed in my experience here - a hotel trying to compete with luxury chains that just doesn't get it.-- Booked a room with a view on a high floor. Got a room on a low floor. They didn't bother to refund the difference ($40/night) until I asked.-- Booked a non-smoking room and it stinks of smoke.-- Service is mediocre -- nobody answers at the front desk. Though some individuals try to be helpful.Overall I would not recommend.
