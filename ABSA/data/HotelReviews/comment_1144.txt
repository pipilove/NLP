A bit over-rated

Me and my girlfriend stayed a week in March 2005. The two pros of the hotel is the location (30m from the far-end-gate of the Place Monge metro station) and that it was clean. The cons were that the room we spent the first 4 nights was the smallest I've ever seen at a hotel (3m X 2,50m) so that 2 persons could not move around at the same time (the one should be sitting on the bed) with an equally tiny shower-WC (2m X 1m). The second room we were moved for the rest of our stay was a little better (because it was for 3 persons actually), overlooking an old arena wich was prettier than the street view we had before. The above mentioned along with the worn towels, a cigarette-burn hole on the bed cover and the chiped bath-tub enamel, gave us the impression that we were paying much more than we should have (€97 without breakfast). Finally, the breakfast we paid an extra €8 per person, was poor compared to the one our friends in another 2 star hotel were having at the same period. Overall, I think the reviews that I read before the trip, in order to book the hotel, overstated the positive sides (qualitywise).
