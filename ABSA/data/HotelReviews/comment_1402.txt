Do Not Stay Here!! These People Only Care About Your Money!!!

Due to a delayed flight, my wife (5 months pregnant) and I arrived at the Nob Hill Motor Inn after the office was closed this past Wednesday night (7/18). There was no phone number posted, just a sign reading, Office hours 7:00AM - 11:00PM so I called information and paid the $2.50 to get the local number for the motel because all we wanted to do was get to sleep. Finally a gentleman came down to meet me and was shocked to hear that my wife and I were there to check-in to our room (that was prepaid and for which I had a voucher that explained the room would be held for us until 7:00AM the following day). He said that they already gave our room to somebody else. As you can imagine, I was less than satisfied. He explained to me the reason for his mismanagement (i.e., not holding a prepaid room for a guest who had not canceled) on this particular occasion was because the motel didn't actually get paid yet and typically does not get paid from brokerages such as those with whom Otel.com contracts until after the guest checks out. While I can understand his business purpose for not holding our room, I still don't understand why the customer (who already paid for the room) is the one left out in the cold - literally...and in this case at 1:30 in the morning with a 5 month pregnant wife in tow. Please, for our sake, do not stay at this motel. And if you do, please convince them to change their policy/arrangement with their suppliers.
