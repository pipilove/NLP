Charming hotel in a great neighborhood!

I stayed at this lovely hotel for four nights with my husband and nine-year old twin daughters. I booked one of the apartments, which turned out to be comfortable and perfect for us. It was not spacious like an American apartment, but by European standards, it had plenty of room. There is so much to like about this hotel, I hardly know where to start. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful and never too busy for our questions. Everyone we dealt with spoke English very well so we did not have to resort to our fractured French.The neighborhood this hotel sits in is charming and quintessential left-bank . Right around the corner, about a five minute walk away, is a wonderful boulangerie, cheese shop, green grocer, wine shop and bistro. And about twice a week, there is a farmer's market here where you can buy everything from fresh fish and foie gras to table linens and jewelry.The metro station and lots of other shops are located here as well.You can easily walk to Notre Dame or the Pantheon from this hotel. Both are about a ten minute walk.The other big benefit of the location of this hotel is the street it sits on. It's a cul-de-sac with a small park on one side, so it is much quieter than you would expect from a big city hotel.I think the only weakness of this hotel is the breakfast it offers. The dining room is painfully small and the menu is very limited. Although, to be fair, they will bring your breakfast up to your room for no extra charge. But given the fact that there are so many other options for breakfast in the neighborhood, this was not a big deal for us. Overall, we had a very positive experience staying here and would not hesitate to stay here again.
