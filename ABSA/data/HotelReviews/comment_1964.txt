most inaccessible hotel of the world

This is an example of a poorly planned, new hotel tower on top of an old department store.To get to your room requires 2 different elevators and a hike across the lobby. Pity of you arrive by car; NO PARKING ; NO CAR DROPOFF.No Taxis either at most times!Getting luggage in and out of the place is next to impossible.The restaurant is way undersized and gets overrun during peak periods; better use one of the local coffee shops (also less $$$).
