Nice enough hotel - Barcelona was very very disapointing

The hotel reception staff were great, very welcoming and helpful and the rooms and the hotel are nice enough.It did get very noisy in the rooms at night though as our room was situated facing a main road and ambulances went up and down all night every night making it hard to sleep.The hotel bar was just a waste of space with no bar staff ever on it, no draught beers and they had even ran out of vodka when we asked so we could not sit and have a drink before bed.As for Barcelona itself it was a massive let down and I really can't see what all the fuss is about. It is overly expensive unless you stay off the main strip and you really need prior knowledge of the good spots to avoid being ripped of (charged €28 for two poor breakfasts and another €28 for two large beers on las ramblas - go slightly off the strip however into a square and there are one or two great restaurants and pubs selling top food and drink for cheap)It is very run down in places and from the hotel you have to walk down 'prostitute street' to get to the main strip. Also the main smell in and around las ramblas and most of where we went in Barcelona is of the sewers.We have been to many places and barcelona is the one place we will be happy never to return too.
