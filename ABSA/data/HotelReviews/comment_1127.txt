Treat yourself

I had read the reviews on Tripadvisor when we were planning to stay at Disneyland Hotel. This was the glamour end to our budget hotel holiday in UK. I chose to stay here rather than Paris Central because I was nervous of my lack of French language skills. In the end basic local greetings became second nature. If fact when my husband yawned on the homeward-bound flight, he excused himself in French! The family made the most on being on site at Disney and in fact skipped a pre-arranged Paris tour to have another day at the park. However when we did venture into Paris itself via RER and Metro, we had no problems commuting. Find out before booking about the Express Check In available for Disney guests departing on Eurostar from London Waterloo. We had not pre-arranged this and although it was not difficult to walk from Marne-la-Vallee station on arrival, having to open all our cases and hand luggage for a bag check at the entry to Disneyland was a bit embarrassing and took the edge off the arrival.
