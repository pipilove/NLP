Loved staying @ Hotel Max!

My boyfriend and I stayed @ Hotel Max for the weekend. We had a great experience! Staff was friendly. Loved the original artwork everywhere. We stayed in the Artist King room. The bed was extremely comfortable, 2 great nights of sleep! Bathrooms were small, but it didn't matter to us. Toilet and sink in one room, bathtub in another room. The closet was a hoot. When we opened the door, we couldn't stop laughing. The width of the closet was seriously like 4 inches! The clothes we hung had to be slid in @ an angle. Flat-screen tv was nice. We ended up using valet parking. Not too excited about paying $22 extra/day + tip since we only took the car out twice, but it was very convenient. Sushi @ Red Fin was delicious! Overall, Hotel Max was expensive, but we really enjoyed our stay there. We'll definately come back again, but probably when there are specials on room prices.
