Hotel Monge: OVER RATED?

Me, my husband and sister all seem to think so. We booked a double and triple (100/130 Euro) based on reviews on tripadvisor and were sorely disappointed. :(My husband  I backpacked SouthEast Asia for 3 months straight so we are not picky or demanding by any stretch of the imagination. Positives: windows are double paned and the rooms are clean. But we think there are better hotels out there. We found the Familia Hotel MUCH better last time we were in Paris (they were booked this time around )1. Staff did not seem to make an effort to be friendly at all. When we checked in we were simply given our keys and pointed to the elevator/stairs. We were suprised since others raved about the service. We barely got a smile out of them- I wondered for a minute if THEY were the ones paying us to stay there. 2. Elevator fits only 1 person with luggage or 2 small people. The dark winding staircase was not much better to lug your baggage up.3. There is not clock or coffee/teamaker in the room. Considering they managed to have a minibar in each room, hmmmm.4. Don't expect to sleep in at all as the housekeeper starts banging and vacuuming at around 8 am. Ok? it's supposed to be a holiday 5. Finally, we found the beds pretty rough to sleep on. I woke up with backaches (normally I never have back issues). The last couple nights I found it helpful to sleep on my stomach.Anyways, hope this helps! I will NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone that I care about. Bon voyage! Paris is amazing :)
