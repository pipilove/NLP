Very nice stay

Friendly staff, friendly owners. The breakfast was great in the morning, more varied and larger than many other options. I was running the Half-Marathon and found the location near enough to the Stadium to walk, but also near enough to the central sights to also walk downtown as well . . . . . so I did a lot of walking in addition to running the race. Nevertheless, some key tram lines also seemed to be within a few blocks, as were places like Concertbouw, Van Gogh and Leidesplein. Voendelpark is also within a few blocks. The room was as I pictured it, with a large, clean bathroom. The owners were willing to be accomodating when I said I might have to leave early for family reasons and then was able to stay. I appreciated the flexibility as I'd been in Africa and out of touch of some things, so was in a bit of a flux the first few days. Free international calls were an unexpected surprise and the internet access helped me stay in touch with my staff back in Canada. Pleasant stay all around and I appreciated the service and consideration.
