Good at what it does......

We stayed here for four nights in May 2008, and although it was adequate I'd struggle to recommend it to anyone over 25 years of age.On the plus side the Hotel Zoo is ideally located within Berlin, being only minutes walk from the central bus station, a rail station  just seconds from the nearest 'underground' station. Because of this it makes a good base if you only need a crash-pad. The hotel couldn't be faulted on what it provided; the room we had was comfortable  very clean; the staff we friendly  helpful; the public areas were clean and the breakfast (although pricey at â‚¬1 per person per day) was of good quality, variety  quantity.However..... What it lacked were the 'comforts' that a lot if people travelling in Western Europe have come to expect. We had no facilities to make hot drinks in our room; there was no room service on offer, so we couldn't even get a coffee if we wanted one; our mini-fridge wasn't working on our arrival  was still broken when we left 4 nights later. Also, the only toiletry on offer was a bottle of shower gel firmly fixed to the wall. We also failed to get anything other than local language (German) TV  radio on the small television provided in the room. Whilst this is partly a criticism of myself for not being more of a polyglot it is the only time whilst travelling on the European mainland that I've had a room without at least one English language channel.Overall I can't recommend Berlin as a destination highly enough, but would struggle to advise a stay at the Hotel Zoo, especially to anyone used to what are now regarded as the basics of European hotels.
