dont believe the hype

Stayed for one week at the hotel, didnt like it on bit. You can not sleep at night from all the noise.. We asked the to fix our safe, they kept promising us , but didnt. Our t.v set didnt have any channels didnt fix that either. The breakfast is expensive for what you get. The rooms are not that clean. Went to this hotel due to te reviews big mistake. Loved paris Most beautiful city in the world. Will return to the city not to the hotel.
