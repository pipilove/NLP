Great Hotel, Great Location, No Air Conditioning

My wife and I just returned from a quick trip to Seattle. We stayed 3 days at the Mediterranean Inn. The location is great, the staff was nice, the room was spacious, and there was a nice little mini kitchennette. The room also had a great window seat which I would reccommend requesting when booking. The problem was that there was no air conditioning in the rooms! It was a hot summer weekend in Seattle, and the room was almost unbearable. We were in the room for about 30 seconds before I called the front desk to ask where the A/C controls were, and were told that there was none. There was a ceiling fan, and the staff brought us an ossillating fan which helped, but not nearly enough. Luckily we were busy during the day and did not spend much time in the room. I would definitely reccommend this hotel, just not in the summer. Apparently they do have a few rooms with A/C on the 6th floor, which I was told were only $10 more ($138) so if you can get one of those, go for it. I have never stayed in a hotel with no A/C and really can't understand why a nice place like this would not have it. The lobby is blissfully cool, but don' t let that fool you. As I said, I would certainly stay there again, but not when there is any chance of warm weather.
