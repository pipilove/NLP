The internet 'good value' rooms are lousy

I had a bad experience cause our room had a communication door with the room nextdoor and our neighbours spent their time doin strange noises, banging the door and smoking dope which almos intoxicated us,,,Awful. The hotel is well placed, but the rooms and the beds need an updating. The staff was correct but I didn't like being secured 115 euros from my credit card for 'possible' expenses. It's a mistrusting policy.
