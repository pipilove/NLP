Awful

I had the unfortunate experience of staying at this hotel in Jan 2006. Upon entering the lobby it was clear that the hotel was far from clean and this was confirmed once we entered our room. The carpet in the room did not look like it had ever been vacuumed and this suspicion was confirmed upon discovering not one but at least 12 rather large toe nail clippings embedded in the carpet. The bathroom had the remains of numerous former visitors which was evident from the variety of different hairs on the floor and sink. The tiles were mouldy and the shower curtain disgusting. I immediatly made a request that our room be vacuumed and cleaned. I was assured that it would be cleaned the next day. My room was never vacuumed the entire time I was there, despite complaing 4 times. The room service seemed to consist of bedmaking only.Needless to say I do not recommend that you stay at this hotel as I am sure there are a number of cleaner more efficient hotels to choose from.
