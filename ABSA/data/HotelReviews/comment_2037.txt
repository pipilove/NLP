Beware: Summertime is teen tour group time

If you're looking for a peaceful few nights in Sydney, look somewhere else. There are large (40) teenage tour groups always coming and going. You will wait for an elevator, you will wait for breakfast, you will be bombarded with constant rumblings from typical teenagers. If this doesn't bother you, you might like the place. It was clean, the shower was fine and its in an ok location.
