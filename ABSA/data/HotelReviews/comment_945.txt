Perfect location

Nice Hotel. We stayed for 5 nights. The service was excellent, friendly and helpful staff. It麓s not the last time we stay at this hotel. Perfect location, near the Metro (We didn麓t use the Metro at all, we didn麓t have to.,) walking distance to a lot of Tourist attractions. Nice and clean rooms. We can only say nice things.
