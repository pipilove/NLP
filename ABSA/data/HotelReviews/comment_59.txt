don't stay anywhere else!

I cannot rate this hotel highly enough. We stayed for 4 days on recommendation and we were not disappointed.The staff were welcoming, the hotel was charming, the rooms beautiful (some with great canal views) and all within walking distance of Dam Square.If you are thinking of visiting Amsterdam please do not look anywhere else!
