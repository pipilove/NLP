Not very good at this price.

Stayed here one night as the rest of Sydney was full (yet again). I'd stayed here in the past when it actually was a Sheraton rather than a Starwoods, and it hasn't changed much at all.My booking was last minute - I paid top dollar at $AUD250. The check-in was very very efficient - but he seemed to take a while trying to find a better room for me. My room was on the first floor (room 163). All they had left was a twin room, with two single beds. The bed was ok comfort wise. And the view was street and main entrance - very bad. The carpet was well worn. The TV was old and on the small side, and the bathroom was on the older side - but adequate. Mt A big negative for business travellers - I saw no evidence of in-room broadband. It is covered by the Telstra CDB wireless broadband service though. This hotel is really full of tourists ... it's close to the tourist trap of darling harbour. It's really not geared up for business travellers.I had the buffet breakfast - $30+ for the full greasy. Yet another 2nd rate hotel where they won't let you sit down without deciding what you want first - full buffet or continental. Really, really, really annoying. How can I tell what I want before I can see what's on offer. Overall, I am sure that there are good rooms in this place - but my room wasn't one of them.
