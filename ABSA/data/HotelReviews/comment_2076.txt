Good location, staff let it down

We had 5 nights at this hotel. We arrived really early in the morning from London and not surprisingly no rooms were available at that time. The staff were pretty unhelpful, but we did get a shower in the swimming pool changing rooms. When we eventually returned to the hotel at 5pm we were given a smoking room despite having booked a non-smoking room weeks before. This in unnacceptable in my view, how can none be available when booked so far in advance? We had to wait an hour to have the bags brought to the room and it took a reminder phone call at that. The room itself was on the top floor and well appointed with nice views. The bathroom was good too. The gym was a disgrace and the equipment had not been maintained or cleaned in weeks. It was filthy and not a good recommendation. On the plus side, the location was excellent and within walking distance of everywhere in the city. Rydges was due to be taken over by another hotel group at the beginning of November. I hope they do better
