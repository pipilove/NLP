Great hotel

We stayed at the Clarion for 1 night in May and it was great! The rooms are very small, but nicely decorated with modern furnishings. The staff was very nice and helpful. You cannot beat the location! The hotel is located right around the corner from Las Ramblas. Wish we could have stayed longer but our cruise left the next day! Highly recommended!
