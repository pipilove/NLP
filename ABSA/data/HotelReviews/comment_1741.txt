AMAZING!!!

  Hands down the best hotel in Seattle Location - Central downtownPrice - Reasonable for the quality of the hotel Rooms - Huge bathrooms are the highlight but everything is brand newService - GreatWhat it lacks - no pool Overall - The Grand Hyatt is amazing and the only place I'd stay in Seattle.
