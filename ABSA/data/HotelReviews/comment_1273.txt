Not a Bad on a Budget

Normally I am a princess when it comes to staying in hotels; nothing short of luxury creeps me out. However, I was on a budget, and so I chose to stay at the Castle because of the rave reviews for this budget motel. I wasn't unimpressed, but I wasn't impressed either. The staff was extremely accommodating, and the parking was free, even after we checked out, which is huge in SF. The rooms were clean and comfortable, meaning I wasn't creeped out. Still, I knew I was staying in far less than a luxury hotel. But, if you are on a budget, The Castle is not a bad choice. (And centrally located)
