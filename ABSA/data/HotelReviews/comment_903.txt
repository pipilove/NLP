Wonderful Luxury

My high expectations were surpassed in our 3-night stay. The hotel's rooms and amenities were all top-notch, as they should be. The spa and pool were especially nice and blissfully uncrowded. But it was the level of service, professionalism, and even friendliness was even better than expected. Our family of 3 was treated royally, even though we're not royalty. The Georges V deserves its reputation as one of the world's best hotels.
