Didn't find much 'Grand' about this Hyatt

I just returned from Berlin, where I stayed at both the Grand Hyatt and Intercontinental Berlin and I was a bit disappointed with the Grand Hyatt. As with most Grand Hyatts the hotel is well located, and the lobby is impressive. The staff is courteous and professional, but as I've found with other Hyatt's throughout the world I also found them too formal and stiff.I stayed in one of the 'Club' rooms on the 7th floor and the room was nicely furnished and very contemporary. But it was also quite small, and had little closet space.In addition, although I requested a 'non-smoking' room, and the room I was assigned was supposed to be a 'non-smoking', it had a strong stench of smoke and booze that would not go away, and since the hotel was overbooked, there were no other rooms I could move to.The gym on the top floor of the hotel is nice, but not the 'greatest' gym in Berlin (I would say Holmes Place as well as others are much, much better). Finally, the hotel was very expensive, and definitely not worth it. When I go back to Berlin I will stay at either the Intercontinental or Starwood properties, much nicer and worth their price.
