Excellent Service, Friendly Staff

I cannot fault the staff and service that we received at this hotel, everyone was so friendly and nothing was too much for them.The rooms are small but are equipped with everything you need including a fridge and reception will provide hairdryer, iron etc on request.I found the room we had to be a bit noisy as we were on the street side as we requested a balcony and it is a very busy road.Please be advised that there are steep stairs leading in to this hotel so it would not be suitable for anyone with walking difficulties but dont worry about having to drag your cases up the stairs as the staff are only too happy to do this.Overall a great stay in a reasonably priced hotel with great location (near Dam square  Anne Frank House) and only a short walk from central station.
