Overpriced, over hyped and lacks Disney Magic

Booked 3-night stay through Disney Web Site primarily for kids to meet characters based on trip advisor reviews and proximity to theme park. No availability for certain dates so also booked Radisson SS for 3- nights. Radisson SAS was superior product in my opinion.Hotel is clean, lobby areas have pleasing aroma, but generally very poor service. Room quality was reasonable but functionality lacking. Booked babysitter at check-in due to business meeting in Paris, form completed and signed but alas form was not processed by Disney staff and no baby sitter was made available, phoned on morning to confirm baby sitter and Manager apologized but was unable to find a babysitter. Service at bars and restaurants was generally very slow but room service was exceptionally good and quick. Go figure! Food quality was excellent and buffet choice is wide ranging. Highlight of stay was opportunities for kids to meet Disney Characters at meal times.First attempt at switching on shower and the spray head fell off, which they fixed immediately but there were other small functional problems that created some minor frustration. For a Castle Club room it was not impressive at all.Staff were generally indifferent but a few provided exceptional service and overall service was adequate but less than what I expected from Disney particularly at the price paid.Family would stay there again but just for Disney Characters and walking distance to Theme Park, family preference was Radisson SAS Hotel which offered a superior product at better value and with much better customer service. Disney can and does do better than what was provided and experienced at this hotel on this occasion.
