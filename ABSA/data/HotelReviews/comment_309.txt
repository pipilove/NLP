Take A Pass

Stayed there for five days on business/pleasure. Location is excellent, hotel is clean, but that's about all the place has going for it.--Service was indifferent, lots ot attitude from the older staff who seem to have lost interest in doing their jobs--Electronic room keys, recently installed, did not work at all. Came back once to find the room of my door open! (Fortunately nothing stolen). Several times I had to return to the desk to have them re-keyed.--Caught the bartender swapping wines on me, pouring a cheaper wine than the one we had ordered. He claimed it was an honest mistake but the reason I was watching him was because he had been doing it all week.--A car service that was supposed to pick me up at the airport never arrived. The hotel charged me for it anyway, because my flight was late. Apparently car services are unable to get the relevant information from the airports.--Construction was going on right next to my room--awoke every morning around 8 to the sound of hammers and electric saws. Requested a room change and was told the hotel was full.It's a straight up, intentional rip-off, not just poor service, so I won't be back.
