Upmarket boys weekend..........

I cannot rate the Banks Mansion highly enough...I was a tad suspicious of the inclusive drinks and particularly as the trip, organised by me, was an upmarket stagweekend/batchelor party for 6 guys, I tried to play this down. However to their delight it was true!! Don't think we over-indulged but great after a night out to chill with some conversation over a beer or glass of wine. Hotel was great, rooms excellent for the money and shower was great! However, what made the difference was that the hotel were so helpful, we arrived early at 9am and although I had warned them asking if they could store our luggage...they went one better and actually had the rooms ready!!! Very impressive. Fantastic weekend!! Also for those who want a dining experience with a difference....visit The Supperclub! (---)
