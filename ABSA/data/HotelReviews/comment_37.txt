Not 5 Star: Starwood should drop this property

in short, this is an OK 3 or 4 star hotel. but falls short in multiple areas from justifying a 5 star rating or pricingi have stayed at the pulitzer on account of my starwood platinum status approx 10 times and with that range of experiences here is what to expectGood:Location and concept (row houses around two canals)Beds and comfort amenitiesFlexibility about early checking inNot so good:Whole place feels run down and under-maintainedService is mostly fine (nothing special) but significant gaps exist, especially in room servicePoor/badRoom assignment is totally random and they do not take care of repeat guests or remember preferences (despite being asked)Food quality if very variable and I got food poisoning onceService attitude and personal attention feels like it slips a bit more with every check in.Have complained to Starwood about all this, however they seem powerless to do anything substantial.Basically this hotel should not be in their luxury collection and travelers should avoid it if they are looking for an upmarket hotel in Amsterdam.  The Hilton is much better service (though less well located) and the Amstel is very good but very old fashioned
