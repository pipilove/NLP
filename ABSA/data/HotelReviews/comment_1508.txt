Cool hotel, terrible service

The Warwick is located in Belltown, an interesting neighborhood with some fabulous restaurants. It has a nice lobby and the rooms were pretty clean. The front desk, however, was a horror show. We had asked for a pot of coffee to be delivered at 6am every morning, as we needed to be up and out by 7. On the third morning, we did not get our coffee, and consequently arose an hour late. And in Seattle of all places! On two separate occasions we asked for the so-called complimentary transportation. Upon the first request, we were told we would have to wait at least a half hour and that we should take a taxi. The second time we asked for transportation we were told our destination was too far away. The point is - don't advertise the service if there are caveats that go with it. The front desk staff was aloof and not interested in reparing the harm, and for that reason alone I would not stay there again. But I do intend to return to Seattle - great town!
