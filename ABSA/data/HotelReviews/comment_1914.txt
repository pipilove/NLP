Fantastic Hotel!

Stayed at the Four Seasons in Sydney whilst getting married. Would recommend this hotel particularly for a special ocassion. We upgraded for $30 per night to a deluxe room which was worth it. We had already booked a full harbour view room and it was well worth the money. The staff were exceptional and even offered to open up the whole business centre floor at 3am for my partner to go on the internet! If you can afford it stay there and even if you can't book the lowest rated room and upgrade on your arrival. We booked direct with the hotel which I think is better as most search engines don't include breakfast (which was also fab,) and we got a $150 voucher for the spa included. Can't wait to go back.
