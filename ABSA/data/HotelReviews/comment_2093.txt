get your own taxi

stayed 31/12/06 until 3/1/07.never again will we go near this hotel.upon arriving in sydney at 8am we freshened up in a freinds room at The Blue , after travelling fron SF over night. What a difference with service they couldn't do enough for you at the Blue , where, as after arriving at The Amora at 2.30pm to check in , there was no bellboy we were told to ask the concierge for advice.we left the bags with him and went to our room, ordered room service, ate room service waited a further 10 mins and then eventually had to ring down and ask where our bags were.It took in total 65 mins for our bags to be delivered to our rooms.On new years day our friend visited and wanted to get a taxi back to her hotel. We asked the bellboy to book one. After 15 mins one hadn't arrived so asked about it, to be told it had been doubled booked so they'd send the bellboy out into the street to get one.10 mins later he came back empty handed. So went to the concierge ,Nathan, to ask about what was happening, only to be told we should get our own taxi and turn his back on us. So I had to get the taxi myself which took only 4 mins.We would highly recommend The Shangri-La (which we stayed in, later on in Jan) or The Blue.
