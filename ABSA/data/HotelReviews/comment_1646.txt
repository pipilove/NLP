Great Hotel

My wife and I stayed at the W for 3 nights in June. I was very happy with the hotel, and we had a great time there. The staff was very nice and accommodating, and the room was very comfortable and modern. As usually, the W beds are awesome. The room also had a flat screen tv, a DVD player, and an ipod radio/clock. The bathroom was also comfortable, and they provide Bliss products. My only complaint was that one of our neighbors ordered room service, and the try say outside their room all day. Oh, and the hallways are unnecessarily dark, although that's not really a big deal. I think they're trying to be swanky, but whatever. The hotel is also in a great location. We walked to a Mariner's game our first night, and its also close to most of the shopping, restaurants and bars. We had dinner at Union and Crush while we were there. Union was very good and is only a short walk from the hotel. Crush was about a $12 cab ride away, but it was well worth it. I love food, and my meal at Crush was definitely one of the better meals that I've ever had.
