nice rooms, extras way overpriced (here is a sample price list!)

Giving it 3 stars, because for a 5 star property, the hotel did not live up to expectations. The rooms are wonderful (5 stars), the staff OK (4 stars), the restaurants I would not recommned (1 or 2 stars). When I plan trips, I am always wondering what the extras cost at the hotel, so here are a few prices for you so that you can better plan your budget/trip. 50 minute massage = 120 Euros + 16% tax50 minute facial = 115 Euros + 16% taxCoke from mini bar = 7 euros + 7% taxWater from mini bar = 6-8 euros + 7% taxCup of coffee in room = 4 Euross + 7% tax (No, the coffee is not free!!!)Room service breakfast = 29-35 euros + 6 euro delivery charge + 7% tax.Room service sandwich = 22-24 euros + 6 euro delivery charge + 7% taxOK, you get the idea! To get a sense of what things cost outside the hotel, a coffee and croissont at the cafe outside the hotel was 2.4 euros and large bottle of water usually costs 1.5 o3 2 euros. A bottle of coke was 1.40 euros. A sandwhich is between 3-6 euros usually. I would mind paying so much at Hotel Arts if I felt like the quality and service met the prices, but sadly it didn't (I could even eat my main course at the Marina Bar restaurant, it was so bland and tasteless and my friend hated his appetizer and could not eat it)Also, while the hotel is near the beach, it is a bit away from the other sites. A taxi to La Ribera/El Born (great bars and restaurants) is about 5 or 6 euros, about 7-10 to Las Ramblas. The metro is 2 short blocks from the hotel, so I used that a lot.
