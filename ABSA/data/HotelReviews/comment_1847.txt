Great rooms, bad service

Stayed here for 3 nights in March. The room we got was great: view of the Opera House, an old English-style building, good furnishings (except a little wear and tear showing on the bathroom ceiling). The hotel's location is pretty good too.But, the service was really lacking. I was staying with a friend who didn't have a credit card and didn't speak that much English but would arrive at the hotel several hours before me. I called the hotel a week early to tell them the situation, gave them my credit card and gave them my Marriott rewards number (I'm 'Silver Elite' in their book). I then called them again about 3 days before my stay asking some logistical questions about getting to the hotel and asked them again if my credit card/marriott rewards number were on file. They said no and took them down again promising that there would be no problems for my friend to check in.When my friend arrive to check in they treated her horribly. They denied having the credit card, forced to put up a hefty cash deposit,barred her from making phone calls from the room, etc. etc. When I showed up and told the front desk what happened they were unsympathetic. And the thing that really gets me is that they had my Marriott rewards number on file. That means that someone did get the credit card number over the phone but that they lost it--twice!!! Of course, I need to watch my credit card number very carefully for fraud now.All in all, we made the most of our stay, enjoyed sydney and the room and avoided the front desk like the plague.We checked into the Grace Hotel a few blocks away a few days later and had far better service and more modern room (with a worse view).
