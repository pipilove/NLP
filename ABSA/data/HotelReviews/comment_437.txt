Very dissappointing

I had booked this room based on the glowing reviews from this site and I have to say I was very dissappointed. I had booked our rooms directly with the hotel. When we arrived they couldn't find our reservation and the hotel was nearly full. We eventually did get a room but not the room we had agreed to. We did get a slight discount but again this was not what I had expected. First of all the room we were in was very dated and needed some updating. Not what you would expect from a hotel of this calibre. The room also needed some cleaning. I sensed this was a room that was used as a last resort and understandably so. The noise level from La Rambla kept us up much of the night . A very bad experience. We requested another room but they couldn't accomodate us so we went across the street to the Hotel 1898 for the remainder of our stay in Barcelona and the experience there was much better.
