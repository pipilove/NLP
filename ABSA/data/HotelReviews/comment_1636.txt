Very Nice with a Unique Urban Flair

This was my first stay at a W property. Contrary to what is written on here--at least by some--I found the W Seattle to be just what I was looking for. As a volunteer coordinator for a group, I was able to negotiate a rate of $136/ night (for 11 rooms). The rooms were immaculate and as advertised, well-equipped. While it's true that the hallways are dimly lit (with difused blue lighting), that's the point! The W Seattle is a funky Seattle property right in the heart of downtown and within easy walking distance to Pike Market and other attractions. If you're looking for bright lights, go to a Holiday Inn or Motel 6. (You'll be sure to get a light of hallway lighting there albeit flourescent!). The staff was very friendly and warmly welcomed my group. We used the Strategy Room which had a nice Boardroom-type setting with a fixed table and built-in audio visual equiptment. I ordered in a continental breakfast for thr group consisting of bagels and cream cheese (average); Starbucks Coffee (always good) and the W's own homemade granola bars (AWESOME!) My only complaint was that the meeting room itself had no windows. I'm one of those persons who likes to see natural light. They do have meeting rooms with windows but they are your standard ballroom types with folding walls to compartmentalize the groups meeting. I was going for a more fixed boardroom. What can you do? That's the way the architect planned it. The lobby is tastefully done and the reception desk is lit by a row of flickering tea lights/candles. Again, not commercially illuminated but that's the point! Something different and unique. I would go back to this establishment--without hesitation. Actually, now I am very curious about other W properties located throughout the country.
