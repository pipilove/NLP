A mixed bag

As others have said, location is excellent but rooms are not well cleaned. The dust on top of the wardrobe looked like it had been accumulating for about 20 years.Internet access at EUR22/day is a rip-off. There are other hotels nearby which offer it free.However, for those of us who like a swim, there's a pool, which is quite rare in this part of the world. I don't understand the complaints I've read, as the pool is a decent size (for an indoor hotel pool), in pleasant surrounds and kept at a good temperature, with other facilities available. The sauna and steam room theoretically cost extra, but there are usually no staff checking what guests are doing.
