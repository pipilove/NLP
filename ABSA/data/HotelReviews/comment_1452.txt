Health Risk - Unsanitary Conditions

After seeing news stories about hotels not washing the drinking glasses in the rooms, I decided to mark the glass to see if it was exchanged. The next day after the room was made up the maid neatly placed the glasses on the vanity with protective tops placed over them. When I checked, sure enough the mark I had placed proved the glasses had not been washed. I notified the hotel manager and she sent security to take a report. That was the last I heard from the hotel manager, so evidently the Parc 55 is not to concerned with Health Department regulations. I guess they got mad that I complained because the next day the room was not made up at all. Finally at 5:00pm a maid knocked on the door and asked if we wanted the room cleaned. I didn't bother to complain just won't stay here again. This hotel is not a 4 star as advertised.
