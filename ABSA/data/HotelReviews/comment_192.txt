Superb Hotel

This is a superb hotel that I actually booked before reading the reviews.My wife and I spent two excellent nights there on 22 and 23rd September 2006.All the previous reviews were spot on. From the moment we arrived the staff were so helpful and friendly.The room was perfect and the flowers I had ordered were in the room waiting (I have never seen such a fantastic bouquet).The location is fine and the complimentary drinks in both the room and the lounge area were an excellent idea.Would highly recommend and will be staying there again for definite.
