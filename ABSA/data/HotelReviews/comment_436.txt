A grand disappointment

We visited the hotel from June 11-14, 2007. We were very disappointed with the quality of this hotel. We booked it based upon the reviews on this site. I expected a high quality boutique hotel and it turned out to be a high- priced (198 euros per night+ tax), run down establishment. The hallways were dimly lighted. The hallways and room carpeting were stretched and stained. The walls were banged up and we had a view of the adjoining buildings' roof tops. The furniture was old. The bed was more like a cot with a pad on the top than a bed. The location is great and the staff is friendly, but the facility is definitely not as advertised. Although it tainted our first visit to Barcelona, we could not change hotels since there was a large convention in town and all of the better hotels were booked. If you're looking for a nice, clean hotel, this is not the one for you!
