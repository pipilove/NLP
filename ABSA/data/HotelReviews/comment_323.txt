Great location; Disappointing service

We booked this hotel for 4 nights prior to a cruise based on Trip Advisor recommendations. We had high hopes, given that it seems to be rated at least a 4-star hotel. I don't have comparisons, as I have never stayed in Barcelona before, but I would rate this hotel as no better than a Hilton in the U.S.The staff were helpful on restaurant recommendations, but otherwise indifferent. Our room was adequate/small and would have been quiet (even though facing the main street) except for a party with children in the next room who stayed up until 2:00 am every night screaming. I finally had to personally ask them to pipe the kids down. The hotel could not change our room as it was August and at full capacity.The hotel was also under renovation at the time we stayed, and the reception lobby was temporarily located at a side entrance. It was small and cramped. The baggage handling staff was insufficient. We waited 30 minutes for baggage assistance upon check-out, then hauled our luggage down ourselves.The rooftop lounge is lovely, but they charged $8 for a small soda - I didn't even consider ordering a mixed drink; as I recall they were in the $15 range.The only advantage I could see to this hotel is its' fabulous location - right in the midst of several Gaudi buildings, in walking distance to everything, and in the high end shopping area, which is much quieter than the mobbed La Ramblas touristy area. We paid $269/night by booking on the hotel web site (3 nights, with the 4th one free).All in all, a disappointment because of the noise, cost of the rooftop drinks, and indifferent service.
