Good location, enjoyed our stay at Orchard

My wife and I recently spent three night at the Orchard Hotel. We chose the hotel because of its proximity to Union Square. Our room was of decent size, nicely furnished and clean. The hotel's staff was courtesy and friendly. The prices in the hotel's restaurant and bar were on the high side but with a number of restaurants in the area, this was not a problem. The one negative was noise from the room next door; the rooms had a connecting door that - I think - allowed voices and other sounds to be heard between the rooms. While this provided for a couple of annoying moments, we didn't lose any sleep or feel the need to complain.Overall, we were pleased with our stay at the Orchard Hotel and would stay there again.
