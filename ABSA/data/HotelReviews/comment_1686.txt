Weekend at the Max

My fiance and I stayed at Hotel Max during a quick weekend trip to Seattle. Overall, I would recommend the Max but hopefully you can get it for a lower rate.I booked the reservation through their website. I never received a confirmation email (as mentioned on the site) so the week prior to our arrival date I called to confirm. Their reservation line apparently doesn't handle the online reservations and transferred me to the Front Desk, she transferred me back to the reservation line. The reservation agent told me to call the Front Desk back again, at a later time, using a non-toll free number. I gave up trying to talk to anyone and tried my luck with email. I included a few extra questions about parking, check-in, etc. That same day I received a stock-reservation confirmation email with no answers to my questions. Not ideal but it was something.The hotel is great. The local art is a fun touch. There is a book containing all the Hotel Max art and artists in your room (it's for sale but you can peruse without charge). The location is also very convenient to many shops and sights. It's about a 10 minute walk to the market.The staff is very friendly. They warned us about delays with valet parking. Unfortunately, even with an early call to tell them we needed the car, we still had to wait 15 minutes in the lobby. We stayed in a queen room. It is small but not too crowded. Very intimate. It reminded me of NYC hotel rooms. It's a converted building so it has a different feel than the cookie cutter large hotels.The bed was great. A bit soft for my taste but we slept well. Negatives: The A/C is noisy and the towels are thin and scratchy. (The towels really should be upgraded.)Our total bill came to $257, this included one night of parking, taxes, and 3 local calls. A bit much for our taste but about average for decent, downtown Seattle hotels that weekend.Overall we were satisfied. We'll probably stay there again if we get lucky and find a lower rate.
