not worth the price

I stayed in a standard room for two nights. The pluses include walking distance to nearby sights and it was clean.Unfortunately, the first night I could not sleep because my room was located right around from the elevator and conversations and doors slamming echoed throughout the night in my room. also, whenever the heater kicked on, it was loud. I switched rooms the next night-- from the 12th floor to the third floor-- which was a bit more quieter but you can still hear doors closing from nearby rooms. Also, the room was not as nice althought it was to be an exact switch. The tiny bathroom lacked a window, was a shower only, and it had a toilet flushing system like what you would find in a public facility, where you stepped on the lever. There were also paint chips on the wall trims.The staff for the most part were nice and polite. The only person I thought was inept was the girl I dealt with when I checked in. I wasn't given a map of the city or offered a coupon to a nearby department store, which I didn't know was available until I switched rooms.
