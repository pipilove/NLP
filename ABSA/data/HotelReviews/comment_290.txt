Very Nice Small Hotel

This is a 16 room hotel on a quiet street in the museum district. It is run by a friendly couple, Hans and Loes de Rapper. The location is convenient for both walkers and those using public transportation. Energetic travelers with not too much luggage can get a tram (2 or 5) outside the train station and be at the hotel within about 10 minutes. Too far to walk with any luggage. The tram will deposit you within one block of the hotel (at the stop just opposite the Van Gogh museum). Taxi's are available, but pricey. Our room was up two flights of fairly steep stairs, typical of other hotels in Europe. A lift is available. The room was clean and very adequate. Not too small. Comfortable bed. The bath was modern and well equipped (hair dryer, soap dispenser, etc.) The breakfast buffet, included in the room rate, was excellent. This hotel was chosen after much research on this and other websites, both for its reasonable rate and location. We would definitely stay here again. An added bonus: discount tickets to some attractions are available at the hotel. Bill and Donna Anderson, Valley Center, CA, USA
