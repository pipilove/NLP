Nice hotel, a few glitches...

My husband and I stayed at Hotel de Varenne for 8 nights. It was quiet and quaint. The courtyard is lovely and we enjoyed our breakfast there in the morning. The room was more spacious than anticipated, but cleanliness was not top grade. There was so much dust on the dark red lamp cover, I drew happy faces on it to get the cleaner's attention. The happy faces remained untouched for our entire stay. The DVD player came with the room, great free selection of movies too! but the DVD player turned out to be broken and didn't get fixed when brought to the attention of hotel staff. FInally, our flight got bumped to 8:30 am (instead of noon) and we let the manager know we would have to take a hotel room at the airport on the last night because we had to be there early and we were 1 hour away by metro. He told us that we had reserved the room and we would have to pay for it. We emphasized to him that we didn't want to leave, our flight time was changed, we had been there for 7 nights and it was 9:00 am - way before the checkout time, and we wouldn't be there for the breakfast which was included in our price. He suggested we take a taxi (about 100 E) instead of the metro (14 E for 2 people) and again stated he would charge us for the room that night regardless. We thought this was inconsiderate and insensitive. In the end, we called the airline, paid for advanced flight booking and woke up at 5:00 am to get to the airport by metro at 5:30. Overall though, we do recommend this hotel to others. It is charming and ideally located for sightseeing; just make sure you don't have a change in plans!
