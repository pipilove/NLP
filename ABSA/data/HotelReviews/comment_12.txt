Three star at best

My daughter and I just returned from a four night stay at the Pulitzer and were very disappointed. I had searched for a good hotel at a rate of up to $300 a day and after much research decided on the Pulitzer. Big mistake. Our room was tiny, and the bath was small too. The public areas were somewhat dingy and showed a lot of signs of hard wear. Even the bath towels were worn and becoming stringy. Speaking of such, the maid did not replace shampoo, conditioner, etc, after the second night. You had to put a sign on the bed if you wanted your sheets changed, and put your used towels in the tub if you wanted fresh ones. The minibar was one of the kind that you have ten seconds to replace a drink, otherwise it is automatically charged to your room. There was a charge of about $5.00 to access the ATT operator from your room.The front desk staff were pleasant, but the concierges seemed about to scream if one more person asked them the same questions (that is even after a decent tip). We saw a lot of tour groups in the hotel and that might have effected the staff attitude. The breakfast buffet was fine, if it is included in your room cost. Otherwise for 20 Euros, you could do much better at one of the nearby coffee shops. As has been mentioned in other reviews, the location of the Pulitzer is excellent, and in easy walking distance of many attractions. Amsterdam is a great walking city, so unless you are out of the Centrum, you should be O.K., that is, if walking is not burdensome.In summary, I would not spend the money to stay at the Sheraton Pulitzer, and would hope that this is not typical of Starwood luxury properties.
