WHAT A LET DOWN!

I booked this hotel because of the good reviews it has on this sight and I ended up extremley dissapointed!!Yes the location is very good and yes the staff are friendly (which you should expect at a hotel anyway!), but the hotel isn't anything special. I had done my research before we arrived and i was expecting a small room and steep staircases. But the rooms aren't just small they are TINY. We had a room at the back of the hotel and you could actually stretch your arms out and touch the walls on each side. The bathroom was even smaller. I dont consider myself to be fussy but these rooms shouldn't be commissioned by the hotel as they are unbearable. I would have struggled to feel comfortable if i had stayed in the room alone because of the size, but with my boyfriend in there too we were constantly bumping into eachother. We couldnt be moved as the hotel was fully booked. We caught a glimpse of rooms at the front of the hotel when the maid was cleaning and they looked much bigger and much more comfortable so maby we were very unlucky. Advice for future guests AVOID ROOM 316.Also a horrible smell kept wafting from the bathroom, like sewage/ drains. It was like we could smell poo coming from the toilet when it hadn't been used! Not very nice. I wouldn't say that the hotel was particulaly clean either, the bin in our room was still full with the lasts guests rubbish when we arrived and the sheets looked as through they had been used since the 1970's. The hotel smelled a bit musty, it wasn't filthy but I think the standards could be improved. I wouldn't reccommend this hotel, and I wouldn't go again. Amsterdam on the other hand was brilliant and we will return.
