Very disappointing stay

I have written a previous review on the Alsterhof and having stayed there again, I thought I should share my experiences with readers on this site. The mark of a good hotel is its ability to deal with the unexpected and its ability to make guests feel at home. On both counts the Alsterhof let me down. When I arrived there was no water for a few hours due to construction work. I was told nothing about this at check-in and only discovered that this was the case when I tried to take a shower. On calling the reception desk there was no apology or alternative offer given. Indeed, what irked the most was that the room was full of overpriced bottles of mineral water that they could have offered to guests during this time to use. Fortunately, I didn't have to wait long. The other thing is that the inroom wifi is outrageously priced at EUR9 for 2 hours. The receptionist told me that I could use the PCs in reception for free. The main difficulty with that is that all the files that I have on my laptop that I need to be able to send to my office can't be transferred to the PCs in Reception. The hotel is OK for leisure travellers but not particularly useful for business travellers. Finally, on my last day when I took breakfast I was treated to a very loud conversation about me by the waiters in the restaurant and the fact that I had checked-out and hadn't paid for breakfast. It wasn't true but it was quite embarrassing and really did not inspire confidence. There was no apology from them for the mistake or the inconvenience. In fact, given that and the fact that you basically have to pay for everything in the hotel, including essentials like shampoo, gives the impression that every penny counts and making the guest feel at home comes last.
