Loved it!

We've just come back and simply loved the hotel. We upgraded late to Executive and it was worth every penny -just 45 euros per ROOM. Fantastic food and drink all through the day, all within the upgrade cost, and exceptional service. Downstairs bar staff a bit laid back but overall level of helpfulness was outstanding. Our room was really just a little small for two people, but we loved the wonderful white cotton bedding (changed each day) and the incredible attention to detail. Apart from the sleping area there was a computer work station and an excellent double bathroom together with more than ample wardrobe space. We had dinner in the restaurant one evening and the food was outstanding. Additionally the airport bus(109) stops yards from the hotel entrance and the U-Bahn stop is also moments away. It was extremely quiet yet its position could not be bettered for shops and public transport. It proved to be excellent value for money and certainly added to the pleasure of our few days in this extraordinary city.
