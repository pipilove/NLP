Stolen iPod Nano, but OK besides that

Biggest problem: our iPod Nano was stolen from our rucksack, most likely by hotel staff. We checked out at 12pm, and left our bags in their storage, since our flight was not until 10pm. After sight seeing, we collected our bags and went straight to the airport, in a taxi, with the rucksack at our feet. After check in, (we had no check in luggage) we realised the iPod was missing. We've since contacted the hotel, but they say they cannot find it, and have no idea. I remember packing the iPod into the top pocket of the bag, and it had been in the hotel's care between the time we checked out of the hotel, to the time we were at the airport. There was no way it was stolen while at the airport as i was carrying the bag infront of me.Gym: great equipment and range of weights; better than most hotel gyms. However, the air con was not on high, so it got really hot. Plus, they played the same music everyday, and it was very slow and mellow, totally unsuitable for a workout.Pool: SmallLobby Lounge: great tapas, especially the seafood. The best meal of our trip. Cost about 100 euros for about 7 tapas and wine, and coffeeRoom: great little touch of a choice of pillows to choose from, all named after old hollywood actresses.
