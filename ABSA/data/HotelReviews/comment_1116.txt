Overpriced and disappointing

I booked this hotel partly on the basis of tripadvisor reviews and have got to say I was very disappointed. The fifth floor superior room was cramped, stuffy, with dated decor and two single beds pushed together to make a double. The hot water did not work properly and we had to boil several kettles to run a hot bath. For 280 euros a night (not including breakfast) it was bordering on ridiculous. Overpriced and not recommended
