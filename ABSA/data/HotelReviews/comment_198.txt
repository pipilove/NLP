Simply the best

Just returned from a weekend in Amsterdam. After reading the reviews from this site about the Banks Mansion we expected it to be good but it far surpassed our expectations. The rooms were of a very high standard with lots of added extras which made it a pleasure to return to after a hard days shopping!!!!. The staff could not have been more helpful, they were always on hand from the moment you book in to the moment you left and nothing was to much trouble. With everything being complimentary from the breakfast to the drinks we can not recommend this hotel highly enough.Stay here and see for yourself.
