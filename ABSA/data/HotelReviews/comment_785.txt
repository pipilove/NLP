Lukewarm chic

Stayed here in early December 2005. Ok, it's only a 3-star, but it was nothing special. The location is not that convenient. The rooms were cold (they were, I suspect, aiming at cool), lacked ambiance and were weirdly designed (I mean, I think my girlfriend is incredibly hot, but I have no wish to see her go to the loo through the glass wall to the bathroom -- any more than she does me). We stayed three days, and the sheets were not changed. But the staff were friendly and the lobby area is not without a certain sexy minimalism. Check out was a hassle given that they were not sure what they needed from us. I've stayed at the Savoy (owned by the same people as Ku'Damm 101 and about 10 mins walk away), and while supposedly stuffy, it is in fact more stylish by far -- and, while a little more expensive -- an awful lot more comfortable.
