concierge excellent, rooms boooo

Well stayed there for a week 23rd dec till 29 dec 07.Good stuff first. Concierge were great booked us a very nice good quality restuarant on the 24th for dinner, also advised us well on everything we needed. Reception, bar area was nice and modern, the only problem was that the bar was a smoking area and for us that was a problem as the was no division between smoking and non smoking. The hotels location was great especially when you are arriving via train, just oppsite the train station and at the start of damark street. Room are ok ,but not a 4 star standard. Would recommend this hotel although for its location.
