Lousy housekeeping

We left our room at 8:00am only to return at 3:00pm. to a dirty room. When I called down to the arrogant desk staff. I was told We have until 7:00pm to clean your room. I had to ask for some clean towels and soap be brought up. About 10 minutes later the housekeeping manager called and said that we could be next on the clean-up list. We declined because how long would we had to wait for that! The only professional staff there is the parking valet staff.
