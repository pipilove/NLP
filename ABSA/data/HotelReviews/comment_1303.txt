Rate confusion

One time I paid $89, the other time close to $200. How much are the rooms really worth? Probably closer to the first rate. However, if you're labeled as a cheapo traveler with a low rate, don't be surprised if you get treated accordingly. You may end up in a sub-par room and not get much attention...Location is great if you're doing business in the Financial District. However, if you are visiting for fun, this neighborhood is b-o-r-i-n-g, especially on the weekends.Be prepared to pay an arm and a leg for any services within the hotel (food, drinks, room service, etc. - all very very expensive!).
