Great location.

My wife and I stayed at the Swissotel for a brief 2 night stay in Amsterdam (Sept. '07). I booked our room very last minute after deciding to switch hotels 2 days prior to our arrival most likely resulting in a rather high room rate. Amsterdam is a very expensive city when it comes to lodging however the Swissotel is worth it if you get a fairly reasonable rate. The location is perfect! It is a very easy walk from the train station to the hotel. It is right next to Dam square and a very close walk to the red light district. All of Amsterdam's tourist attractions are very close and we walked everywhere. The staff were friendly and spoke very good english. The rooms were a bit small (normal for european standards) but were clean. The Swissotel offers a nice place to relax after experiencing all of what Amsterdam has to offer. Bottom line:Location is great!Staff nice.Clean hotel.Decent but overpriced food.Quality bathroom.Safe provided.Internet access in hotel....In all I would return to Swissotel but would not pay $517 US dollars a night (my fault for changing at last minute). If you are looking for pure luxury then do not stay here but if you just want a nice place to stay while you enjoy Amsterdam then this should work well.
