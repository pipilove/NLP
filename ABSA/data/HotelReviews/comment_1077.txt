lovely place to stay

this is a great hotel for a visit to the beautiful city of paris. the location is pefect the staff are friendly and helpful. the rooms were small but ideal for our needs. the rooms were very clean and we had a great view of the eiffel tower. overall i would recommend this hotel and i would stay there again.
