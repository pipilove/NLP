Terrific rooms

I travel to SF frequently and have passed this hotel without noticing it many times. The TripAdvisor reviews we so good I decided to try it last week. I'm glad I did.Thhe rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. My king bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was big and bright. Breakfast buffet was good, too.This hotel is located on Nob Hill and is a convenient walk to the Financial District, Union Square and China Town. The Powell St. cable car goes right by it.
