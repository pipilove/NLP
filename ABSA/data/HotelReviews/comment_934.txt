Nice hotel, shame about the staff

Stayed in a junior suite for a romantic weekend away to propose to my girfriend. The suite was quite modern and a nice size. Bathroom was ok, although one of the taps was broken.The room was the best thing about the hotel .... it was nice.Breakfast was overpriced, æ‹¢20 euros for Croissants and eggs. I was disappointed with it I must admit.Service at the hotel was fairly awful. The two things that spring to mind were:1) Booked at the front desk for dinner. Arrived in the restaurant for dinner and no booking at been made.2) We had been advised by email that we could have a late check out at 3pm. Arrived back at the hotel at 2.30pm to find we had been locked out of the room. the reception staff had the most awful attitude, and I had to go upstairs to prove to get the piece of paper that showed we had been granted a late checkout. i can live with the fact that they made a mistake, however what was worse wasa) I knew there was a problem as I queue to complain about being locked out the room, i could could hear the staff talking about me (and it was clear they were moaning!)b) I never got an apology for the mistake they made.Overall, this spoilt what would have been a nice hotel. I would not stay here again, not just because of the service (as I'm sure 99 out of 100 times you'd be ok), but because of the disappointing breakfast, and the lack of professionalism of the reception staff.
