Terrible!!!

From the moment I check in to the time I left there were a number of problems in the hotel and the service from the staff was extremely poor.Since I booked a club room I had access to the club lounge where I checked in and there I was told I had a no show the previous night although I had a booking confirmation showing the correct dates. The staff promised I wouldn麓t be charged but of course they did and after several telephone calls they refunded my credit card.The club lounge was the only good thing about the hotel, located at floor 33, where delicous food five was served times a day along with french champagne and a large variety of wines.Later the same day the water stopped running in my room and after a long discussion with the staff I got a new room but not at the club level which meant constant problem to get to the club lounge even though the staff promised the new key should work to get to floor 33.On my last day I was going to see football and the tickets were delivered to the hotel 3 days before my arrival but the concierge found them a few hours before the game started after having searched for them for 2 days!!Do I need to say that I don麓t recommend anyone to stay at Arts Hotel Barcelona?
