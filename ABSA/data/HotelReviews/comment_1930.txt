Not Four Seasons Caliber

The hotel is adequate, but certainly not of typical Four Seasons caliber. The rooms are tiny, the bathrooms are even smaller, the look of the hotel is dated, and many rooms smell of smoke (even on non-smoking floors). My husband and I switched rooms three times and concluded that all the rooms in the hotel smell like smoke and are small. One more word on the smell: we had them send an air purifier to our room on two separate occasions and it made no difference either time. Of course, however, because it is a Four Seasons, certain elements of the hotel were great. The room views were awesome (we overlooked the harbor and saw both the Harbour Bridge and Opera House from our window) and breakfast buffet is delicious. The bar downstairs is very happening (great live jazz), and they serve delicious munchies with all drinks. Location was great (right in the center of everything) and the gym was large and had nice equipment. If in Syndey again, I would not stay at this hotel. It truly isn't of the FS standard and I believe that another hotel could easily outshine this dated Four Seasons.
