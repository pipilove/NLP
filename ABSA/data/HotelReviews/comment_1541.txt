Bed Bugs!

My boyfriend and I stayed here from Sept 2-5. We usually stay at the Springhill Suites Marriott, but decided to go the budget route. A co-worker recommended this hotel knowing I wouldn't mind the lack of amenities (bring your own soap etc.), or the poor shape it's in. I have to say I wish I'd stretched the budget.The first night was fine, likely because we were drunk when we went to bed so we didn't notice anything.The second night I was pulling down the covers and crawling around on my pillow were 2 BED BUGS! I had booked 2 beds for more space so we thoroughly inspected the other bed and slept in that one. The next morning we saw another bed bug crawling around on the wall next to the bed we just slept in. We took our dead bed bugs downstairs and spoke with Mike (the manager). He was apologetic and claimed this was the first he'd heard of bed bugs in the Moore. We were booked to stay a third night, but were planning on going elsewhere. Mike said he'd help us out with the bill and find us another room so we decided to stay.The third night we came back at around 2ish. The night guy assigned us a new room on the 5th floor. We dragged everything to the new room, inspected the beds, unpacked, returned the other key and went back upstairs to finally go to sleep. As I pulled down the covers to go to bed I saw another bed bug crawling along the sheets. This time when we killed it it exploded with blood so it had obviously made a meal out of someone. We packed up all of our belongings again, called a cab, checked out (at 3:30am), and went to stay at the Holiday Inn Express.This place is a nightmare! (and I'm not even a squeamish person)!
