Great Hotel

Just returned from a five night stay in Barcelona. The Hotel Jazz is a good hotel - the hotel, rooms and bathrooms are very clean. The room was a reasonable size with LCD TV and minibar. The bathroom was clean and well stocked with toiletries - hairdryer is located in bathroom and not in main room. Hotel staff were friendly on arrival but did not speak unless we approached them. Do not recommend that you buy drinks in the hotel bar or from the mini bar - very expensive. Did not eat in the hotel so cannot comment. Would recommend breakfast/drinks at the bar opposite (d'Or) as reasonably priced and very friendly staff. Would recommend a visit to the hotel roof - pool looked inviting and plenty of sun loungers. Unfortunately weather in November did not allow us to sit and relax by the pool. Hotel is close to Placya Catalunya - but more than the 100 meters from La Rambla stated on Expedia. Would definitely recommend you see the following: Sagrada Familia, Casa Batillo, La Pedera and Pablo Espanlo. Entry to all discounted if you buy a Barcelona Turistica bus ticket. Give yourself plenty of time to see each as you will be suprised by the amount of time spent in each. Bring comfy walking shoes! Good buy is Don Simon Sangria from the Champion Supermarket on La Rambla (Euro 1.79 per bottle). Market just off La Rambla is best place for snacks.
