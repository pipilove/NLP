Wharf on one side, ghetto on other

On one side of the hotel was Fisherman's Wharf just a few blocks away. On the other was a kind of seedy area with lots of bums. The neighborhood the hotel is in wasn't the best. We always kept it in our heads that we should get back to the room before it got too late. There were some problems with people at the front desk, one younger guy (can't recall his name) was uncooperative and unprofessional. Our airconditioner wasn't in the best working order. We had a nice size room with 2 double beds. My parents' room with only one king bed was really small they wanted to change, but the hotel was booked up. Breakfast isn't included in the room rate, although there is a restaurant adjoined to the hotel with decent, average-priced food. I think it was around $10.00 for an omelette. We expected a better hotel and even thought This is it but it was reasonably princed. There are so many SF hotels, we should have taken more time to find a nicer place. It wasn't necessarily bad, just not any thing great, either.
