Wrongfully Charged for Room cancelled

We had made a very early fully refundable reservation to stay at the Hotel Pulitzer through a travel agent but had the travel agent cancel the reservation a couple of months before our arrival date because we had a found a better deal. Though our travel agent promptly cancelled the reservation, the Pulitzer still charged us and refused to credit us despite the fact that they could provide no documentation to explain their position . It was not until months later that the credit card company resolved the matter in our favor. I am shocked at the way this matter was mishandled by the hotel.
