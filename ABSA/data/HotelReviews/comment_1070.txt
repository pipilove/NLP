Pity about the great reviews!

Chose this hotel because of all the wonderful reviews on Tripadvisor and was really excited about another visit to Paris. However, on arrival we were told that our room was unavailable (sick child - heard it before, must be unlucky!) and we would have to go to a hotel across the road. We ended up really lucky in the Relais Bosquet with a superior room which was huge (unlike the Cadran) and with free breakfast (which we didn't have in Cadran), and where the service was exemplary. Suspect we were moved because others were prepared to pay more! Not a good practice and extremely annoying!
