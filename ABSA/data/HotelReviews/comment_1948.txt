Good Service, but disappointed with rooms

I stayed in the Swissotel, following reviews on this site. While the staff were efficient in the sign-in, sign-out process, I did encounter a few things that made my stay less enjoyable. The first problem was the room size. The rooms were unexpectedly small. Some websites give the swissotel 5 stars, but this is not accurate. The rooms were designed so there is just barely enough space on either side of the bed for me to move around in. When you look at the photos posted on the hotel's website, the rooms displayed are quite deceptive; the actual room looks about 2/3rd the size. The study desk is small, and cluttered with all the hotel information-related reading materials.The second problem was the bed. The mattress was uncomfortably firm, and I had a difficult time sleeping on it. It was nothing compared to the other beds used in hotels like Sheraton. (i.e. the Heavenly Beds). It took me over 2 hours to fall asleep on these beds. A third problem was the room service. If you need any items from room service (for example a toothbrush), it takes about an hour for room service to have it delivered, which I think is unusually long. So in summary, the stay was a bit on the disappointing side, and I probably would not stay in this hotel again. It is *NOT* a 5 star hotel, but more accurately, a 4 star.
