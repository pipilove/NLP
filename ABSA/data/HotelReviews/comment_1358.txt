A Golden Experience (no fleece!) at the Argonaut

From the dapper attire on the doorman to the professional yet personal attention from the bellhop, we were immediately impressed with the Argonaut. And then we saw the room! We had a very spacious room on the 2nd floor, overlooking the lively courtyard, with an exposed brick wall and windows that open -- not to mention a marvelously comfortable bed and bedding. Prime location for strolling along the pier (don't miss the Maritime Museum!), to Ghirardelli Square -- and only a block to the cable car, two to the F Line Streetcar that goes all the way to the Ferry Terminal building, then on to the Castro neighborhood. Enjoyed talking to fellow travelers during the evening wine reception in the lobby, breakfasts at the Blue Mermaid -- but be sure to visit the Buena Vista -- across the street from the Argonaut -- for an Irish Coffee with your eggs! Spent a week there in September and can't wait to return!
