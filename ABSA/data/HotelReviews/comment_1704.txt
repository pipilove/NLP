Lukewarm Experience

My husband and I recently stayed at the Hotel Max for an anniversary weekend. The decor was fun and funky. Our room was spacious and comfortable, but there was a step up into the bathroom which would make it impossible for a disabled person (and dangerous in the middle of the night if you forgot it was there). We asked to be moved after the first night as the air conditioner seemed to have only one speed and was quite loud. The next room was a bit of an odd layout, but ok.I had made a video of our years together and saved it to my iPod. The TV monitor would not accept any auxiliary output, even though the monitor itself was set up for it. When I called the front desk they said it was set up that way so that they could make money on Pay per View. There was nothing they could do about it and that's just the way it is.The hotel is conveniently located, but the $30/night parking charge seemed high. Overall the experience was okay, but I would probably not opt to stay there again.
