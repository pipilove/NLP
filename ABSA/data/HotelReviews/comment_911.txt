very nice hotel, but the management...

This is on point of architecture and decoration for sure one of the nicest hotels in the world! The staff is outstanding...but you must like this kind of FAKE acting staff, forced by the manager behind to smile even more then needed! I had some problems during my stay, and must say that even the follow up is great, you must like the acting of the Director of Rooms Devision and the Front of the house Manager and her Assistant, because they act like they know you for years (would not even whish it!) and are actually laughing in your face behind. Anyhow if all the other deluxe hotels in paris are overbooked, you can start thinking of going to the best hotel of the world (for guest for sure, wondering for staff...!)
