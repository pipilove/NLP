Sweat over small stuff

The room was superb and the service is good as you would expect from a 5 star hotel.Only 2 things I wasnt quite happy about: - no complimentary water. They left 1 bottle of water but it is chargable at euro - for toilettries, only provide 'hair and body shampoo' and 'body lotion'They are small issues but with the 5 star price I pay, I cant believe that they are so stingy on these small supplies!I wont stay there anymore.
