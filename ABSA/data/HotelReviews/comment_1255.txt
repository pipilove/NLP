Great place for Central SF

Most travellers' reviews were good for this hotel, which is why we chose it. Our experience bears out the truth of these. Whilst the rooms may be considered small by US standards, they are perfectly adequate, well furnished, and very clean. There was more than enough space to move about easily, with comfortable chairs, as well as a desk. The free wifi was particularly appreciated. The huge walk-in closet for clothing and baggage, meant no clutter in the bedroom. The hotel staff were wonderful; very helpful and friendly. Full marks to them for customer service. We are horrendously light sleepers, and found the hum of a heating unit on a roof below (we were on the 6th floor) a bit disturbing as we like to sleep with the window open. Because of this we asked if we could change our room, and this was done very quickly and without any problem. A tip - if you want a really quiet room, ask for one at the back of the hotel above floor 10. We took breakfast every morning in the hotel's restaurant, Luques. Excellent food and service and great value. Try the scrambled egg with greens! We also liked their Protester breakfast - juice, coffee, fresh fruit cup and wholewheat toast - and there are other options.We would definitely stay here again. The only thing we would suggest as an improvement - and this goes for ALL US hotels - a means of boiling water in the rooms. Coffee and tea in the lobby is not terribly convenient if, like us, you need an early morning cuppa to get going!Andrew  Amanda
