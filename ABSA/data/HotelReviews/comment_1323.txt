Best Rate Guarenteed...I don't think so!

After much procrasternating, I finally decided to stay at the Argonaut. Alpharooms.com was showing a fully inclusive price of $715.01 for the four nights in November...Pretty good I thought! I always prefer to book with the hotel directly if I can so I contacted Kimpton Hotels and asked them to honour their web site promise of a price match. Karen mentioned some nonsense of not having the right type of room and then just said that they do not honour fully inclusive rates which goes directly against their web site promise. Having spent over 30 minutes on the phone from London, England, I now feel that Kimpton Hotels have been just plain dishonest about wanting to accommadate their propective guests. I'm sure it's neither legal nor in fact good business practice to make offers you simply renage upon, therefore, I will not be staying at the Argonaut in San Francisco but, I will be complaining further. I'm involved within the customer services industry in the UK where this would simply not be tolerated. A very sorry tale which leaves a bad taste for this traveller! I wish you better luck!
