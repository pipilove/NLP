It'll be great when it's finished!

We stayed here for one night at the end of March due to a mix up with our booking at the Eiffel Seine Hotel. We were most impressed by the quality of the decoration and fittings in our room - the large comfortable bed, the flat screen TV with internet access and the Versace bathroom. Loved the designer cups in the cosy breakfast room.The refurbishment looks to be almost complete as the reception area was being painted whilst we were there.Highly recommended.
