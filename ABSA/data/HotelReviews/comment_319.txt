Great hotel in Barcelona

Just returned from a 3 night stay at the Majestic. The location of the hotel is wonderful, walkable to everything (we walked to the port a couple of times and also walked to Parc Guell), but not in an area overrun with crowds. The room (a Deluxe) was wonderfully clean and well appointed. The service, typical of European hotels, was not top-notch, but still serviceable. Nice bar on the ground floor and a separate Cigar Bar across the hall. Would definitely stay here again.
