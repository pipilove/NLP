Rude young manager. Terrible Service from this man

The hotel itself is not bad but there are serious problems with the lifts. I misses my bus because i got stuck in them and had to stay stuck in them for 30 minutes. Then when i complained to a young man (possibly a manager) at reception he lauaghed and said i had only been waiting for 10 minutes. this man then refused to pay for my taxi or compensate me for my misses bus to Poland. The service of this man was the worst i have ever seen in my life and it was plain rude to actually tell me i was only in the lift for 10 minutes. The lift was broke with me in it for half an hour! I had reported this from as soon as it broke and when i complained that i missed my transfer he laughed. I have never seen such bad service in all my years of travel. I will be writing to the manager and complaining and also be asking for compensation for my missed connection. Absolutely Awfull service from a young male worker
