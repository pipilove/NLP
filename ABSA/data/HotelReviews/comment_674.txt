Less of the attitute, gals

Last two days in Germany so decided to push the boat out and book the *****, got a good price and most importantly the promise of a kingsize bed. Upon arrival, checked in went up to the room and was very dissappointed. The room was a bit shabby, several cracked tiles in the bathroom and the bed was not kingsize. There was the space for a kingsize bed alright, but two single mattresses had been pushed in and there was a gap between the bedside table and the mattress!! I went down to the reception and gingerly approached the subject of the bed size. There was about 5 Gastapo power dressed receptionists manning the desk at the time, most seemed a bit scary!. Was it because they thought I had got the room too cheap?, it seemed a bit like that to me. Anyway they sent me off to look at another room which was equally as poor. Back down I went and when I produced my bit of paper that clearly said kingsize bed, they gave me the keys of a decent room. Their attitude was shockingly bad and I truly believe they were judging me on my appearance (regular - holiday mode, not powered up though!) and also that I had booked a cheapie.
