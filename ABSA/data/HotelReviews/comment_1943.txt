Great value and location

My wife and I travel to Sydney quite regularly and we always try to stay somewhere different (the 5 star hotel options in the CBD are huge). The Swissotel however is such good value and has such a great location (for shopping) is sometimes hard to justify other hotels. On this trip we booked a 1 bedroom suite which included breakfast and drinks in the executive club. $A314 a night gets an immaculate large room with modern fixtures (2 x flat screen TV, espresso machine, large bathroom) and good executive services. Its location is perfect for shopping and it's not far to walk to Circular Quay or the markets if required. This hotel definately doesn't have the stuffy atmosphere found at many of the other local 5 star hotels and although it isn't super luxurious, it is great value for money.
