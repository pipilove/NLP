Hilton was just fine

We, a Scottish couple, decided to visit Berlin for four days and after reading positive reviews regarding the location of the Hilton, we decided to opt for that. On our arrival, we discovered that the hotel had overbooked and that there was to be no room there for our first night. We were a bit annoyed because the location of the hotel had been our primary reason for booking. We were asked to have one night in the Intercontinental and come back to the Hilton for the remainder of our stay.The Intercontinental was fine and on our return to the Hilton I have to say that the staff could not do enough for us. We had a room upgrade and a variety of gifts, free dinner, etc, to apologise for our inconvenience. The staff and in particular, Doreen the acting front desk manager were all superb and truly went out of their way to make our stay more special.Breakfast choice was great, only slight criticism was the room where you have breakfast, sort of reminded me of a works canteen but that aside, choices were good and plenty of food available.Overall, you could do a lot worse than to go to the Berlin Hilton as the location is absolutely spot on for the underground, shopping and sightseeing and of course at this time of year there are a few Christmas markets within walking distance. All in all, we had a great time.
