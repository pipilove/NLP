Not So Grand Old Dame

I was assigned to a tiny room in the old (original) building. The corridor and room gave off an offensive odor that I associated immediately with uncleaned carpeting. After having difficulty sleeping due to the smell and getting little satisfaction from housekeeping, I undertook my own efforts to eliminate it with a fabric spray cleaner. It took and entire container to do the trick but it succeeded in getting rid of most of it. I later learned that thesw small, least desirous rooms are the ones assigned to guests with animals in tow. There were no drawers to store clothes and no coffee maker in this standard room. The pricey coffee bar in lobby asked $2.75 for a small coffee. You an do much better a block down Powell at Starbucks. It seems that management intends to get as much revenue out of this aging dame before re-branding it to a 3-star property. It's so old and has been re-habbed so many times that another attempt could not succeed in meeting Westin standards. Most of those guests staying in the old building (as opposed to the newer tower) appeared to be on package tours from the Pacific room or other international locations, or others who booked discounted rooms.It's a shame because, with a little effort directed at cleaning carpets, the entire experience could have been much different. If you are checking the Westin website, these rooms can be identified as those with no view.'
