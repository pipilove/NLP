Great Hotel and Excellent Value!

I stayed at the Chancellor on July 5th and 6th. I arrived a day earlier than planned, and the hotel was able to accomodate me immediately. All of the staff that I encountered was friendly and helpful. The room was smaller, in the European style, but it was a perfect size for me. The tub was wonderful-it was very deep and perfect for a long soak after a day in the city. The bath salts and rubber ducky were an excellent touch. From the hotel, it's easy to access BART and the cable cars, and it's within walking distance of great shopping, resterants, and theater. For a first time San Francisco visitor, it is darn near perfect.The Chancellor is an outstanding value for the dollar. I highly recommend it for its value, cleanliness, and convienance.
