Great location, but...

The location of this hotel certainly can't be beat, and the staff was very pleasant. However, we found the room we were in (Room 407) to be small even by Parisian standards, and the furnishings were tired and worn. The bed had the thinnest mattress that we have ever slept upon, and the pillows were almost nonexistent. For the price we paid, you can do much better. This hotel needs a serious room make-over.
