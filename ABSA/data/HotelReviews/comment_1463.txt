NOT a 4 or 5 star hotel

Traditionally reputed to be one of the best in the City, this hotel unfortunately disappointed again.Years back, on my wedding night of all things, this hotel told me I had no room (after making a reservation months in advance, ordering roses, champaign, etc.). Now, years later, I decided to give them another chance. Here's what I've experienced:Paid that little bit extra to get a room that overlooks Union square instead of ugly roofs. My wife, who visited the room first, told me the hallway and room smelled like urine. Thinking she was overly sensitive, I reserved my opinion.. When I arrived, I had to agree. Quite disappointing to pay the big bucks and smell urine.After trying to forget this, I take a shower. Wife notes as I'm getting out that there is a patch of long black hair on the shower wall. Neither she nor I have long black hair. Gross and no excuse.Then, tonight, the main restaurant and bar advises, at 11 pm on a Saturday night, after the big USC v. Cal football game, the bar is closed. Go to the reserve lobby bar which closed at 12:00. Closing this early on a busy night in the City? Are you kidding me? Based on my past experiences in the City, you can do much...much better elsewhere. I recommend the Omni or Hyatt for better experiences in the same (or lesser) price range but with better facilities and service for the price.Couldn't even order a movie without calling the front desk to order it without giving them my credit card no. Like they didn't have it already when I made reservation or my wife made spa reservation. Weak service for very high prices. You can certainly do better.St. Francis seems to be resting too comfortably on its old reputation. In the last few years, this hotel has gone down hill in getting rid of a classic restaurant, a separate good old SF bar and a nice lobby. All this without any mention of the $45+ they charge per night to park your car. Don't forget to add that steep charge to your room rate.
