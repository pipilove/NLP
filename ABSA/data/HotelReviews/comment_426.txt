Great hotel...but bad location

We had booked into this hotel for 4 nights, and after reading the reviews on this site, requested a room on a high floor at the back of the hotel. When we arrived the hotel did assign us a room on the 8th floor, but one at the front of the hotel.The noise from the busy road and accompanying roadworks was very loud, and kept us awake most of the night. We requested a move first thing the next morning, but they couldn't offer us an alternative room as the hotel was full. We checked out and moved to another hotel. If your sleep is important to you, we would not recommend this hotel.However, we had a fantastic meal in the hotel restaurant and the hotel itself is very modern and clean and our room was quite spacious.Just very noisy!
