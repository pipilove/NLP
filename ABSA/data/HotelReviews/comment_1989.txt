Relaxed stay

We stayed for one night over the long weekend and had a good experience. We also arrived early, and they tried to get us straight into the room but unfortunately it was unavailable (we hadn't expected it to be available!) But they checked us in, took our bags, and when we came back after hours of sightseeing we picked up our key and our bags were in our room - all very easy.The room was nicely fitted out, hotel lobby was very impressive, serivce across the board was good and helpful. Hotel is also in a great location. Only minor downside was drinks in the Level 1 bar on the Sunday night - I just dont think they had anticipated the crowds on a Sunday night of a long weekend, and they were woefully understaffed, which led to the staff being stressed, spilling drinks because they were trying to rush, etc. But it was understanable! The drink prices were extortionist, but that is what you get in a hotel bar.We booked direct on the hotel website for $250, and I thought it was good value.
