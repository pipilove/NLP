Cheap and cheerfull

Just come back from 4 nights here and was again treated very well from the staff. I have stopped here before and can highly recommend it, the rooms are small, but they have everything u need, the rooms are clean and it's also quiet.The price is very reasonable considering the location and I would definately stop again if there are rooms available. I can recommend it and you wont be disapointed if youve booked a room here.
