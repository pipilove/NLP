Close and Yet So Far

My boyfriend and I attended the Penny Arcade Expo in the Wash. State Convention Center this summer, and the Sheraton was in the best possible location. This was one of its sole redeeming factors.While the room was spacious, and the furniture was beautiful and well-made, the linens were of the cheapest quality. The towels were thin and scratchy; there were no robes. Our pillowcases were stained, and the room had not been very thoroughly cleaned.We were paying nearly three hundred dollars a night and had booked the room for four straight nights. We considered this cost, though fairly staggering for us, to be worth it. However, when we got there, we were constantly nickel-and-dimed. Over thirty dollars a day for parking. What respectable hotel, especially one with such expensive rooms, would have the gall to also charge lodging for their guests' cars? For what we paid for those rooms, they should have been courteous enough not to ream us on parking. Added to that were the $10/day charge for internet, which I could have gotten for free at just about any coffee shop, and the pay-per-view movies which cost between $10 and $15 dollars each. I understand that these are luxury services and that some fees usually apply, but the blatant avarice of the Sheraton on such matters when they were clearly not hurting for revenue was just appalling.Besides their convenient location, I would mention that the attentiveness, friendliness, and efficiency of the staff with whom we interacted were consistently excellent, and it is this, more than anything, that prompts me to give more than one star. The parking attendants in particular were very helpful with allowing us access to the garage if we needed to get to the car, but weren't going anywhere in it.I recommend this hotel only if you don't mind blithely throwing money around, and if you bring your own towels. Next year, we are trying somewhere else.
