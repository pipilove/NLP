Nothing Special

Stayed during a business meeting; was upgraded to a club level room. I was expecting something nice but really could not tell the difference between a standard room and a club level room(if you asked). The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was alright. Put the AC on high, but the room still felt like a sauna. The hotel staff were very courteous and the valet staff had their work cut out for them...Overall: If you are coming to Seattle on vacation, I would go somewhere more unique. If it's for business, I guess this place is alright
