Good Location, Nice Hotel, Great Time

I booked this hotel on hotwire and got a great price of 107 p/n for a weekend. Our room was clean, nice and the staff was very friendly. The beds were so comfortable,it was hard to get up in the morning.Tip- Upgrade for $30.00 to the club level and it includes 2 free breakfast buffets ( 43.00 savings ) The facilities are great the pool and jacuzzi were fantastic, the cardio room was nice but I didn't have time to take advantage of it. All and all we had a great stay! Can't wait to go back !!!!
