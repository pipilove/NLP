Boutique value in heart of SF

Stayed here for just 1 night for a business trip, and found it through other user's reviews on Trip Advisor. They were right.....I thought this was a great bargain for a boutique hotel right in the heart of San Francisco. Large bathroom with nice tile work, large stall shower. The style, the location, and the price all added up to a good experience. Two complaints though: the bed, although not uncomfortable, was a little lumpy. There's no box spring, just the mattress.And the free WiFi never actually worked for me. I couldn't connect. My colleague didn't have any trouble, so maybe it was me. But that was a little annoying.And the restaurant in the lobby was nice as well. Overall it was a good experience, and I'd recommend for business travel.
