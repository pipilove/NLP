Very central location

Just got back from 4 nights in Amsterdam and stayed at the Grand Krasnapolsky. We had no problems and no complaints. front desk was helpful,check-in was quick, room was clean and comfortable. If you are going to Amsterdam to see the sights and can walk, this is a great central location...less than 10 minute walk from Central Station,many restaurants within walking distance,and always a lot going on right outside in Dam Square to people watch. If you want a lot of quiet though, it can be a noisy area at night
