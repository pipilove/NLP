Deeply disappointing

Having booked a deluxe room at the Pulitzer, we were very much looking forward to our one night stay. However, from the moment that we had to walk through a series of corridors that got darker and more tatty the further we went, our expectations were disappointed. Finally, having lugged our suitcases up a winding and dirty staircase we got to our room. It was small and smelt very strongly of smoke. When booking, I had ticked the non-smoking preference and neither of us felt comfortable in such a smoky atmosphere. When my husband returned to reception to ask if we could change rooms, he was told we had requested a smoking room, which was untrue. The woman at front desk was unprepared to do anything to rectify the hotel's mistake other than to offer to have some air fresheners sent to the room. We were extremely unimpressed by the quality of service we encountered. Further, there was damp on the wall behind our bed, the view was of ugly air conditioning units and the bathroom was so small that you couldn't stand up to use the toilet. The high price we paid to stay here does not represent value for money as far as we are concerned and we would choose to stay at an alternative hotel in Amsterdam in future.
