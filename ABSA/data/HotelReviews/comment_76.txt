Overpriced faux luxury

We recently returned from a trip to Amsterdam and Germany, traveling with a family of five. We stayed at this hotel on our last night as we had a flight out of Amsterdam and it's convenient to the train station. We had 2 rooms in the Royal wing, which were OK, but definitely not worth the money we paid compared to other hotels on our trip in the same price range. Hotel Krasnapolsky seems to cut corners to give guests the appearance of luxury without actually having to pay for it. The rooms are attractive, with hardwood floors and modern furnishings. But they skimp on the big ticket items. Other hotels in this price range have very fine linens and down comforters. This one had heavier synthetic comforters and less expensive bedding. There are robes and slippers and abundant little goodies in the bathroom, but the flourescent lighting in the bathroom was dim and depressing. The decor was bargain-basement trying to look expensive -- faux granite on the bathroom floor and no evidence of design or artfulness anyplace in the hotel. I knew it was an old hotel and expected to find at least a hint of its former elegance. I didn't. I'm glad we didn't pay the 21 euros apiece for breakfast in the Winter Garden. (there's a very nice cafe next door with a huge breakfast for less than half that.) I suppose what you are paying for is the Hotel's Dam Square location, but considering how easy it is to get around in Amsterdam, and considering how noisy and dirty the Dam is, why not stay some place a little further away and just walk over? As to convenience to the train station, it's about a 3-4 block walk which is fine for someone who isn't traveling with kids but we ended up taking a taxi to the airport anyway!
