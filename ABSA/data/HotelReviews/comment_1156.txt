Great little place - a bit overpriced

This place is a really nicely fitted out hotel. Its small but not too small. The bed was super comfy and the guys at the front desk were pretty helpful too. Great location in a neighbourhood with all the necessary shops. There's a laundrette right across the road too which was handy. The only problem we had was that we booked the 5th floor with Eiffel tower views and when we arrived, they'd given it to someone else. The view wasn't quite so good in the room we were given - looked straight onto other windows and walls. It'd be worth phoning to confirm your room if you book the tower view room. Other than that, the hotel was just what we needed.
