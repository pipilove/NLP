Great Location!

The location of this hotel was great. We didn't have views of the harbor, not sure if any of the rooms have the view. We were on the 12 floor. It was a two blocks away from Circular Quay. It is a great location to catch the buses, metrolink to Darling Harbor, and the trains. We caught the train to Blue Mountains. You can easily walk to The Rocks. There are some great restaurants within walking distance. The room was clean and the bed was SUPER comfy. We got there earlier than our checkin time, but the front desk was really nice and immediately showed us to our room. There are a lot of choices for hotels in sydney. Although I was content with the Marriott, I may try smething else the next time around.
