Good base

We stayed for 3 nights. The hotel is very clean and the staff are good. It was a great base with the Underground station outside. yYu feel that it's certainly in the East Berlin side, with very functional buildings around this stark and huge plaza.Little cafes, for breakfast and the Galleria shopping centre are outside hotel. The breakfast is expensive in the hotel, and the cafes are fine for a croissant or a roll and coffee.The beds are most comfortable, and the bathroom fine, if you're staying with your partner!The Kilkenny Irish pub is close by in the Hackescher Markt station. Look out for the following restaurants:Mutter Hoppe on Rathaustrasse 21, and Brauhaus Lemke in Hackescher Markt. For a snack, buy a bratwurst for a euro on Alexanderplatz!
