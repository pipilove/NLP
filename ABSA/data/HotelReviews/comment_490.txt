Great place to stay

We stayed at the Torre Catalunya for three days and had a terrific time. The hotel was amazing and had everything you could have wished for. It was totally spotless, everyone who worked there was extremely polite and it was in a good location.The hotel is situated literally a stones throw away from the station and metro that can take you into town and takes about 5 to 10 mins. We took a tour bus for two of the days and that was great and the stops were right outside the hotel. It's great that the station was so close as we didnt have to rush in the morning of our flight, we just walked a few seconds to the station, got on the train and the third stop was the airport and was so quick and easy to get to!This is a gorgeous hotel to stay in. You even have a computer suite with internet access, a lovely beauty parlour with swimming pool and beauty room and also an amazing restaurant on the top floor of the hotel with amazing panoramic views across the whole of Barcelona! Definately 10 out of 10!
