Good location

Just stayed there this week. The location is great and the price couldn't be beat. Easy to get to off I-5 and right around the corner from the shopping district. Pikes Place Market is 5 blocks (10 min walk) straight down Stewart Street (which the hotel is located). The staff was great and attentive. Get a local map from them and have them explain the area. Most of the town can be done simply by walking. However if you goto Woodland Park take a cab or drive. The hotel itself is very nice. However I found the rooms small and the bathroom basically the size of a small closet. If you are a large person then attempting to shower will be problem. The hotel pics are exactly what you see. The hotel is definitely worth it but like I said, if small bathrooms aren't your thing then I would look elsewhere. Enjoy!
