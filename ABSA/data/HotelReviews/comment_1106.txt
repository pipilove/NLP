great location, watch your belongings

The view is great (if you have a room facing the Tuileries). But watch your belongings. A significant amount of cash disappeared from my bag while stored for an afternoon in their baggage room. Management was less than helpful. Blamed me for leaving cash in the bag. Did not propvide any assistance - like contacting police. Management seems to think stealing is OK if the opportunity is there.A tripadvisor memberNew York CityMay 5th, 2008
