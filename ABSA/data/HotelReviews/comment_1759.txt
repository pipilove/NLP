way cool watertown!

my husband and i stayed at the watertown 2 nights and absolutely loved it! our room was immaculate and hip decor. we felt very safe with the room key use in the elevator and parking below was perfect. hubby loved the high speed internet and i had fun with the spa cart.....it didn't all work perfect but was free so no biggy. room even had free microwave popcorn-yum. the shuttle service was great for going downtown; saved us from parking and getting lost. plenty of restaurants and espresso within walking distance and trader joe's right up the street. we enjoyed walking around all the funky shops a couple blocks away on 'the ave'. free breakfast was good and convenient. all the staff were very nice and professional, although did have 2 phone calls not returned. our room was quiet, a/c worked great and the bed was beyond comfortable! loved the aveda products. check in and out was quick. just can't say enough good things about watertown and we really hope to stay again next year!
