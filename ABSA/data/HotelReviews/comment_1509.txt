Good Hotel - Bad Wifi

This hotel completed extensive renovations in 2006 and the rooms are lovely. Although the rooms are modern, the hotel has the feel of a traditional hotel. The staff are all well dressed and well mannered and very professional. The location is convenient and there is a small gourmet supermarket across the street open until 1AM.  As other reviewers have mentioned, however, street noise is a factor to be considered. The hotel has floor-to-ceiling single glazed windows and even on the 8th floor, trucks and buses could be heard at all hours of the day. Seattle is a very hilly city which adds to the vehicular noise. Most importantly, if you are planning to use the wi-fi internet access, BEWARE. It's about $10 per day but the signal strength is super weak and inconsistent. I had to stand next to my room door to get a halfway decent signal - at the desk there was almost no signal. Hotel staff acknowledge this and have a LAN conversion kit which didn't work either. Bottom line, if internet access is a factor, stay elsewhere.
