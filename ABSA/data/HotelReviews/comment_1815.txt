Three comfortable weeks at the Holiday Inn Darling Harbour

We spent 3 weeks in January at this hotel for business/pleasure and were very pleased with the room and service we received. We splurged on a suite which made for a very comfortable stay. Only thing that really needed improvement was the fitness room. It is very small and the machines are in desperate need of updating. The suite could also use a microwave oven. Location is fantastic for getting around the CBD and Darling Harbour. Train system is maybe a 10 minute walk to Town Hall station. If you enjoy Asian food you will be in Heaven - Chinatown starts here.
