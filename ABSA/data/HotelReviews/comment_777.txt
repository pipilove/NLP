Not so sure about location

I stayed in the Arcotel Velvet whish is ten minutes away but on passing the Jolly Hotel when i was in Berlin I did wonder about the noise as its a Very Busy area with the S bahn U bahn and the tram all in front of the hotel.I think the hotel I picked is better as it central but not on top of things!
