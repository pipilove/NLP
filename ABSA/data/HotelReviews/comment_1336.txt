Great location, awful service

This hotel is in a great location, close to Fishermans Wharf and the cable car stop. I had read the reviews prior to going and booked, as I thought, a room with a bay view through my travel agent in England. (Six months prior to travel)I contacted the hotel prior to leaving the UK to make sure we had a twin room. Got a reply saying they had done a free upgrade from an interior room. Emailed back to say I had ordered room with a bay view, then hotel decided I only had a room with a view - this is a view of the cannery but they would upgrade me, no charge. Be aware when booking that you ask for precisely the room and view wantedArrived after nearly 24 hours travelling to be given wrong room. They then disputed my upgrade - I had printed the email. Eventually got the room we wanted a day later but by then our view of the hotel service was very wary. New room had non working TV and overlooked building works.Nice hotel but I won't stay there again as we had better service on previous visits to the Hyatt and nearly same location.
