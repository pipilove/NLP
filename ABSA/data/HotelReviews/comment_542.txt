Superb hotel!

We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights and it gave us everything we needed. Rooms were comfortable, modern and clean. The location was good, close to shops and restaurants. The staff were excellent, extremely helpful whenever needed and always greeted us on entrance. We took advise from other reviews and requested a room above the 4th floor to lessen any street noise. This I guess worked because we were not bothered by anything, also I believe the streets were less busy during the time of year we visited.All in all, couldn't have asked for more!
