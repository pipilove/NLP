excellent hotel,great value

just back from a 2 night stay in berlin and had to post a review of this great hotel. booked the hotel via the holiday inn website and got a great rate of â‚¬124 per night(advance purchase),i have stayed in holiday inn's before and knew what to expect and was'nt dissapointed, clean room, nice decor, friendly staff and good service. this hotel is perfectly placed for sightseeing in berlin,potsdamer platz is only 10 minute walk away,another 10 minutes will get you to the brandenberg gate or as numerous others have mentioned you can hop on the s-bahn at anhalter bahnhof which is only a 5 minute walk from the hotel and the city is yours to explore(and it's cheap!). we were lucky enough to be there for all the christmas markets and the atmosphere was amazing, would definitely recommend december as a good time to go if you like the christmas buzz. already planning my next visit to berlin and will definitely be staying in the express by holiday inn again.
