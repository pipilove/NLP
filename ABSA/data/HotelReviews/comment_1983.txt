Rethink the Radisson

I've just returned from a rare, very much anticipated long weekend in Sydney with my sister, and am now looking forward to a good night's sleep! We booked the Radisson after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor, and were hoping for a bit of luxury to spoil ourselves. Instead, we got a very average room (okay, we booked on Wotif, but even so). We had booked two single beds, but basically got a king bed that had been split in two but both sides were still right next to each other (I mean literally, about half a centimetre gap) - not ideal at all. The beds were peculiarly made with thin mattresses on top of other enormous mattresses, with sheets that didn't tuck in properly and it all just kept sliding off and coming untucked. There were two odd bedside lamps hanging right down from the ceiling at head height, so every time we got out of bed or sat up we banged our heads. We didn't even get saucers to go with our cups. Our bath plug leaked, and our lamp wasn't working (to be fair, they did fix the lamp as soon as we told them about it). The swimming pool was average (the pictures do it a lot of favours), the steam room smelt horrible, and the spa was tiny and closed for maintenance. The whole hotel felt like a bolthole for airline staff and for corporate conferences.Good points: great location, beautiful building (on the outside only, at least in our experience), staff quite helpful.Bad points: completely unrestful.What a waste of a holiday! Sydney was fun though.
