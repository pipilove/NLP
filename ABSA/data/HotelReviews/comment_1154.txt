leaves alot to be desired

6 of us stayed there late Oct. 2006. 2 of us were in a room on the first floor near the kitchen. Noisy and no ventilation. Staff misled us that the air conditioning would be fixed and it was not; we were finally told on the last full day that they were transitioning to heat so no a/c would be on. The vent/fan did not work in our room. Lift was out the first day for 2 of our group that travelled early. Small rooms; showers small, not very functional. Manager was angry at us for asking about the ventilation issue. Had to argue about a price adjustment for 4 uncomfortable nights. Not close to a metro station but close to Eiffel Tower. Nor were there lots of good restaurants around but breakfast places were good. Nothing was cheap.
