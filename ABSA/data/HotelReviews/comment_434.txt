Nice clean hotel

Booked this hotel for a getaway city-trip with my wife.Modern new hotels. Staff was Ok, but nothing more than that.Impeccable clean room. Everything quite new. No problems whatsoever. Breakfast OK too.Very well situated near metro, and within walking distance (10') from Ramblas. This hotel offers all the modern comfort any reasonable traveller cal expect. Good value for money.
