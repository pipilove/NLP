Clean, quiet, convenient

This was my second stay at the Mercure Hotel Berlin an der Charite, and on both occasions I've found that it met my needs and was generally good value (it was booked for me by a colleague I was visiting). As a woman travelling alone, I also appreciated the fact that I felt safe here.Location: convenient for public transport, for access to the main station (Berlin Hauptbahnhof), and for the Humboldt University of Berlin. The staff are all helpful, efficient, and speak good English and in some cases a number of other European languages. Rooms are spotlessly clean, showers are good, and beds are comfortable for one, though I agree with a previous reviewer that for two tall adults the double beds would be a little cramped. Bedroom lighting: good in comparison with many hotels where it's insufficient. Heating/cooling: when I stayed in early June, Berlin was experiencing 30 deg C temperatures, so I kept the window shut and used the air-conditioning - very effective and quiet, if not very environmentally sound. The breakfast buffet is of good quality and offers plenty of choice.Minor criticisms: 1. I would have appreciated a safety-deposit box in the room, and a kettle etc. to make hot drinks; however I appreciate that this facility is less common on mainland Europe than in the UK or US. 2. Internet access was convenient, fast and reliable, but very expensive at nearly 20 Euros for 24 hours, unless you just wanted a few minutes (0.3 Euros per minute up to 1 hour in any 24 hour period). A budget/mid-range hotel should really offer better deals than this.Otherwise, a good choice for this area of Berlin.
