OK if you like cramped

The Hotel Andra was perfectly adequate. However, it was rated by Travel and Leisure as one of the top hotels under $200, and from the website I was expecting a posh experience and was underwhelmed.The hotel lobby was attractive, however only one elevator worked for the entire time we were at the hotel. We had a standard room, it was so tiny that I bashed into the sharp corners of the bedframe as I walked past. Also tiny closet and bathroom. Hotel was old and only modestly refurbished. Regarding the location, I would have preferred to stay closer to Pike's place - Inn at the Market might be good. We had to walk through a couple of sketchy neighborhoods to get to where most of the attractions were. However, the bright spot was it was surrounded by excellent restaurants - Lola (attached), Serious Pie (across street), and Dahlia (didn't try, but served their amazing Coconut Custard Pie at Lola).Staff was helpful.
