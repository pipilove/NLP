Disappointing

We booked this hotel based upon some reasonable reviews. Sadly, it turned out to be a big disppointment. It appears that some of the more recent (poor) reviews are more reflective of the true standard of this hotel. Our room was small but since we spent most of the day sightseeing, this was no real problem. More importantly, the room was incredibly worn and dingy. Also, the shower did not work properly. There was only a trickle of water from the shower which ranged in temperature from freezing cold to scalding hot. In addition, there was little soundproofing meaning that we were woken up by lots of people coming home at night. Overall, the hotel is badly in need of some refurbishment and is very over rated on this site. I've given it a two star rating because it is relatively cheap, the location is not bad and the staff were reasonably friendly. However, I would certainly try somewhere else next time.
