Nice location...but...

The Hotel staff were attentive, and I enjoyed the location (near Brandenburg, Museum Island, etc), but I wasn't blown away. I stayed in one of the renovated rooms, and the room itself was quite comfortable--but very small. My main impression was that the place seemed rather empty, even though I was there during one of the busiest weeks for Berlin tourism (ITB). If you want a quiet Hotel near tourist sites, this is for you. If you're looking for that famous Berlin nightlife, look elsewhere.
