Standard room bathroom more like 2 star

If you go to this hotel don`t book a standard room. The room was ok but the bathroom was tired and in need of refurbishment. The shower was in the bath with the shower head hooked up. This swivelled about when turned on, making it difficult to stand under. There was no thermostat, just a hot and cold mixer tap. I had a nasty fall when the shower suddenly became very hot.I would not recommend this hotel.
