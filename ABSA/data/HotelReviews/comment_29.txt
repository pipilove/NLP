luxury?

a five star rat in my room ! Don't get fool by book reviews and movies, this hotel is not a five star luxury experience, it dosen't even have sanitary standards! I planned a trip with my parents who are 70yo, and I wanted to treat them with a nice experience in one of the best hotel in Amsetrdam. We were having drinks in my room when a rat walked by our feet! I could not believe my eyes! The manager said that is common in old houses by the canals in Amsterdam! Do you think that's an appropriate answer to give to a guest to pay more than 500 euros a night? Orrible experience! I never had rat in my room, not even in India! My parents were shocked! The hotel, on top of the rat, is totaly overated: the decor is standard, the room are like a sheraton hotel by any international airport, the concierge could not find me tickets for any concert in town, the staff is tired and not helpfull. Trust me save your money, this hotel it's a total joke!
