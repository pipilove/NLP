Lousy Walls, Lousy Internet, Lousy Room Service

I stayed at the Argonaut to attend a conference. If you stay at the Argonaut, you will be at the mercy of the people in the rooms next to you, as there is virtually no acoustic insulation. You can hear conversations at normal levels, as well as the TV. The internet is agonizingly slow. Cannot watch streaming media and large files take forever. I also notice other computers appeared on my places section (MacOS 10.5) That was a bit unnerving. I used room service one night and actually got a recorded message asking to leave my name and room number. After 20 minutes I called again and got the same message. So I just kept redialing and got through. I order soup and a salad. The food arrived 40 minutes later, and the soup was lukewarm. The decor is OK, if you like a nautical theme. I don't think I would stay here again.
