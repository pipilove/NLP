Disappointed

We were disappointed with the Swissotel in Amsterdam. We had reserved a smoking room with a king bed but were told they had only no smoking rooms available upon check in. They offered a smoking room with two twin beds but I refused and demanded a complete refund. Seems to me when a four star hotel takes your money in advance to hold a reservation - they ought to have a room you agreed to. Finally they decided to let us smoke in a non smoking room with a king bed as long as we keep the window open. To top it all off the room had NO view. The window literally opened directly to a large bank of airconditioning and heating equipment despite advertisements boasting all rooms had a view of either Dam Square or a side shopping street. All in all very disappointing. Next trip I will try the Krasnapolsky across the street.
