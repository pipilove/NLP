Great shopping location

Great location for shopping. Opposite the QVB shopping mall. Within walking distance of Sydney's attractions.Hotel room very comfortable. The hotel has a laundry room you can use but the tokens are quite expensive but cheaper than laundry service.Pleasant staff.The executive lounge was good. Open during the day. Would have benefitted from a few snacks during the day. Breakfast was a little monotonous as they don't vary it from day to day.Would definitely recommend, however.
