Nice location at decent price, but you can find better value in Barcelona

The hotel is in a good location (near all the main attractions and near the underground) but the area is not great and the rooms are just ok. Considering that in Barcelona you can find very stilish hotels at good prices I think this is not the best value hotel. Hotel Jazz or Hotel Soho are more stylish, albeit a bit more expensive. Nothing bad about this hotel but the room furniture is very ordinary, and very much like a NH hotel, which is a more downmarket spanish chain. I think NN hotels are supposed to be more upmarket and more stylish, so this one is a bit of a disappointment in this sense. However personnel was very nice and the location is good, my complaints relate only to the furniture.
