terrible reception service!

The hotel is very charming but the service is almost brutal. I dared asking why was I charged 139 instead of the advertised 109 and the man at the reception instead of answering me walked to my son of 4 playing at the pool table and grabbed the ball he was playing with saying babies can't use it. He never bothered answering to me, he just walked away. The third bed in the bedroom wasn't made on arrival, on asking if it could be made we only found the sheets on top of the bed and had to make it ourselves. We received only two towels for three people and no bath mat, one key for 3 people, the room is cold for our standards, I'd say about 18 degrees and internet wireless reception in room 9 is almost nihl (although we're charged for it).Yes it's charming and beautifully done, but I'm not happy nor would I suggest it.Guglielmoh
