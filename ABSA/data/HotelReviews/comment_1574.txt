Sheraton Seattle - Good Location, Dirty Toilet!!

My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton Seattle a few weeks ago. The lobby was not open (still under renovation, I guess) when we arrived, so the reception and concierge desks were shoved into a crowded hallway. Check in went smoothly, and we were given a room promptly even though we arrived a few hours before the official check-in time. When we got to our room, we went to use the bathroom and the toilet was FILTHY! I will spare you the details, but clearly it had not been cleaned after the last guest. Housekeeping did respond quickly and cleaned the entire bathroom, but that negative first impression still lingers. The rest of the room was OK - typical decor, above average bed, decent view of the city from our 20th floor room.  The major strength of the Sheraton Seattle is its location. It is basically across the street from the convention center - perfect it you are attending a conference. It is only a few blocks from Pike Place Market and lots of restaurants and shops. There is a restaurant and a bar at the hotel, but I didn't visit either. No place to get a quick cup of coffee at the Sheraton though. I tried to get take out coffee from the restaurant, but the request seemed to confuse everyone. It took about 20 minutes for them to figure out how to sell me some coffee in a paper cup. I couldn't believe it was so difficult to get a cup of coffee in SEATTLE! Luckily there are coffee shops on every corner once you leave the hotel. Overall, the Sheraton Seattle was OK. Its location made up for its weaknesses, but that is only because I was attending a conference and appreciated the proximity to the convention center. If I were going back to Seattle just for vacation, I would probably try a different hotel.
