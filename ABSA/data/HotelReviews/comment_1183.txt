Great Location, subway noise

We spent 5 nights over US Thanksgiving holidays. Great hotel for individual service, for location, for decor, huge bathrooms. However, DO NOT accept rooms 701 or 702 if you are a light sleeper (like me.) The rooms are on the ground floor, off the courtyard. You'll hear every train which pulls through the station below, from 5:00am until 1:00am. The management wouldn't move us, saying the hotel was full (for 5 nights??). We had prepaid, best deal I found was on hotels. Hotel location is great, just across the street from Rue Cler (a foodie's dream). Eat breakfast at a cafe there, rather than at the hotel. Rue Dominique, an easy walk, has several of restaurants by Constant, which are superb. Use the Supermarche across the street for snacks and sodas.The hotel management was very helpful in getting us a last-minute taxi to CDG, after the Bluevan called to cancel our ride (an hour before pickup). Do not book Bluevan without a backup! The hotel recommended Yellowvan, and said they could have booked that for us with notice. E-mail the hotel with any requests in advance--they DO respond.
