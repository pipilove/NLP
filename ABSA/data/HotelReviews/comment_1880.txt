good hotel. great location!

hate to be predictable ...but this is in a great location. staff are friendly and efficient although check out queues were a bit long (mostly because of a troublesome man who had no working credit card and yet still assumed he could move on regardless!)a good base to explore this city..my wife and i stayed there as part of a wedding anniversary trip....the porters etc were so nice and we were up graded to a suite which was absolutely beautiful. we were also provided with a botlle of bubbly and chocs.and a card! beautiful touches!id have no hesitation in recommending this hotel for visitors....only drawback ,if it is one, is that the front bar is quite quiet.....but who cares...uve the whole of sydney to explore!we spent 6 nites there...and while that may have been slightly too long for a stay in sydney in our opinion it is certainly a thumps up for this hotel
