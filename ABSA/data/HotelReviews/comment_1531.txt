Simple hotel close to Pike's Place

The hotel is very close to Pike's Place Market. We went every day. The rooms are simple but comfortable. Our room even had a fairly big closet. It is noisy on the weekends, but we brought ear plugs anyway. The hotel staff was young and knowledgeable. It does get booked up on the weekends these days because of all the cruise ships leaving from Seattle. This hotel definitely has a hostel-feel to it.
