Excellent value for money

Have just returned from a 4 night stay at this hotel and would confirm all the previous good reviews. The hotel is spotless with the rooms being thoroughly cleaned each day. Breakfast was also very plentiful with the buffet being constantly re-stocked. Location is very convenient, although having arrived by bus from the airport, first impression as we walked past the waste ground at the side of the hotel was that it was out of the way but once we got a map from reception we realised this was not the case. Would certainly return.
