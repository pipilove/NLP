Amazing value from Priceline

Four night stay which we pricelined at the amazing rate of $48/night!!!! The same price that we had been paying for youth hostels in Munich and Salzburg!!Location: In the Mitte, not a whole lot in terms of retail in the immediate vicinity (seemed to be mostly office buildings and empty lots) but only one block from the Spittelmarkt U-Bahn station, so very convenient to get around. Breakfast did not come with the Priceline rate and was pretty pricey otherwise, so we ended up breakfasting at cafes in the Potsdammer Platz area. Hotel parking was also expensive so I ended up parking the rental car on the street in the Templehof neighborhood and leaving it there for a couple days.Obviously a newly built, well-maintained Courtyard Marriott. Checkin was easy (reception almost gave us breakfast for free until I asked her to check again) and reception was very friendly (giving us a call to the room when partner left his travel documents at the desk). Room was large by European standards and well-furnished. Windows opened and our room was high up above the courtyard so very quiet. The bathroom was one open room with a shower alcove. Reminded me of bathrooms in Bulgaria (which generally don't have any separation between shower and rest of bathroom). Bathroom was quite large and a shower curtain separated the shower area from the rest of the bathroom so wasn't a problem. Oh, so comfortable beds. Linens were like new although not as luxurious as the Mercure we had stayed at a few days earlier. Complimentary bottle of water was a nice touch and the coffee/tea service was replenished every day. We noted the sauna and exercise room on our floor but frankly didn't have time as we were out running around all day and night and getting back to the room late.
