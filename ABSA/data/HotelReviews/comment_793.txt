great room, excellent service

We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights in February 2005 in the executive room - great room with street view, very comfortable bed, spotless bathroom, good breakfast (you may choose btw restaurant and lounge room), access to the lounge room with great coffee, sandwiches, soup, salads, drinks etc, great location. The only turndown thing was the hotel reception that checked us in, she said that only atrium view rooms were available because the hotel was fully booked, next day we've got a street view room which made our stay very pleasant - other than that the service was excellent.You may book all your tours in the hotel, the bus will pick you up from the hotel in this case. We booked it through Expedia and had to walk to the bus. We highly recommend this hotel.
