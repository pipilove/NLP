Nice Outside, Horrible Inside, Too much $$!

Upon driving up, this place looks cute. Hanging baskets, newly refinished OUTSIDE front doors, freshly hosed down. Alright. But then, you enter. Ooh, yucky. Very outdated and dirty. The bathroom had very outdated cabinets that were beat up. And to add insult to injury, we paid exactly 807.00 for two nites!! Total ripoff for what we got.
