Pretty good

We used the hotel as a base for our holiday in Australia so stayed there three seprate times over a three week spell. The rooms are small, so book a suite if you like a bit of space. The website photos do tell the truth - there is just the one armchair in a standard room. The views are good, but stay high up to reduce the traffic noise.Breakfast is good and breakfast staff are brilliant, but plan your trips to the toaster. The bar is still a bit smokey and receptionists can be a bit offhand.However, we were very comfortable here; the bellhops were marvellous, housekeeping were prompt and efficient, the bar staff were great and the location is excellent for access to Circular Quay and the Rocks (and also for buses to Newtown for economy dining).We had just stayed at the Shangri-La in Singapore, so it was a bit of a come-down to stay here. I might consider staying elsewhere next time, just to get a bit more space for a reasonable price.
