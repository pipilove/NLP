mid week break

Stayed as mid week break. Overall the hotel was great with a very convenient location. Expensive for what you get but balanced against the convenient location. Staff very accommodating apart from one bad experience with a duty manager. The handle of the door to the ladies health suite changing rooms broke leaving guests unable to access the room. The Duty Manageress had no sympathy nor empathy for my wife's inconvenience at waiting in the corridor for ten to fifteen minutes until door was fixed. Small issue maybe but amplified unnecessarily by the fact that it was raised in the requested customer comment sheet filled in before leaving. Noone has got back to us from Marriot with a reponse suggesting the after break service is not high on hotel agenda. Spent approx 750 euros over two nights so disappointed at lack of response to our only gripe of the stay. It has made us question whether we use same hotel on another trip to paris next year.
