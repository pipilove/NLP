Basic, but good value

I chose this hotel because it is close to Hyde Park where the Australia Day celebrations were being held. Check-in was very quick. My room was small, but adequate. I asked for a quiet room and was placed on the 16th floor, with a side view, but away from the busy intersection and noisy traffic. The room contained a microwave, fridge, kettle  iron. The bathroom had shower, but no bath. The hotel has its own shuttle bus to the airport. The hotel only serves breakfast, not dinner, but I prefer to eat out.There are plenty of cafes  restaurants close by. Be wary of Oxford Street area with night clubs, bars, poor cafes - looks dubious. Go towards Liverpool Street  Elizabeth Street - much better. About 10 mins walk to monorail or subway. Walk to harbour is a 30 min stroll.I would describe this hotel as clean and basic - nothing special, but nothing wrong either.
