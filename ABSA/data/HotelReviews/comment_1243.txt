Excellent location

The hotel is clean and comfortable (with a pillow menu should need it!!), but it's main selling point is it's position - perfectly located in the heart of San Francisco, just across the road from Union Square, and on one of the excellent tram lines.Ultimately, SF has so much to offer you should spent little time in the hotell, but when you do, the Chancellor is perfect as a well-run city-centre hotel.(Just as a word of advice, we almost stayed in a hotel in the Fisherman's Wharf area of the city - glad we didn't; this area is a bit tacky and seasidey with little to really offer other than trips to Alcatraz, which is not to be missed. Much better to stay around Union Sq, and take a tram ride.)
