Good location, good hotel

I stayed at the Westin Grand this past weekend during my trip to Berlin to run the marathon. As a family member of a Starwood Hotels employee I have stayed at many Westin properties and this one was about in the middle in terms of quality. On the plus side, the location was great. It is close to public transportation, close to many of the city attractions and close to the start of the marathon. It also was great to have access to the spa and pool before and after the race. I also agree with many posters that the breakfast was great. They also did not charge me for my 7 year old son and he eats quite a bit. On the negative side, was the fact they did not change towels on one day and only stocked the bathroom supplies once for a 3 night stay. Additionally, room service for a pot of coffee took 1 hour. I stayed in an unrenovated room with a view out the window onto Fredrichstrasse. This was nice since I could see a portion of the race route and could watch roller bladers and runners go by from my window. Overall the stay was just above neutral.
