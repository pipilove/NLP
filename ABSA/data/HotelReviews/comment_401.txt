Great location

Just had short stay at the Royal, it is located in ideal location for visiting central Barcelona being located at the top end of La Ramblas. Our room was comfortable and quiet and located at the back of the hotel.The staff were very friendly and helpful, particularly looking after our bags after official check out, and directing us to several place that we had chosen from the guide book.Thoroughly recomend and will definitely return.
