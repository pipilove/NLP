In Need of a Makeover!

We had booked in to another hotel which had water damage. The Ares was booked by the other great hotel (Hotel Duquesne Eiffel). At the Ares Tour Eiffel we payed 160 Euros for a room with no air conditioner, you could hear the guests upstairs every time they walked around theier room. Family called us telephonically to be told we were out for dinner - we were in our room. Staff were not helpful. This hotel is completely overpriced in comparison to other hotels. The inside has a tired look! It is in need of a makeover!!! Thankfully we only stayed one night and moved to the great Hotel Duquesne Eiffel
