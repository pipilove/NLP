Comfortable and good service

My wife travels 20 weeks/year and stays in many hotels ranging from Best Western to Four Seasons. We found this hotel to be very comfortable, the room was large, the staff that we encountered were VERY friendly and helpful, and the area was NOT any worse than any other very large city. Yes there were homeless and the Tenderloin isn't far, but I felt no worse than I did in NYC or Phil or DC. Union Square is just as close as any bad area so it really isn't threatening. It's just a city, man.
