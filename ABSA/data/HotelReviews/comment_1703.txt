Do not stay here

This hotel was terrible. Broken elevators. Cold, drafty, heat didn't work. Was the coldest night I'd ever spent indoors. Called the front desk and asked for a space heater, but none ever arrived. Went down to the front desk at 5am to speak to a manager, but none was on duty. Checked out after a terrible night and switched hotels. The hotel agreed to refund my charges for the night. About two weeks later, however, I checked my credit card statement and saw that I had been charged about $350 by the hotel, including a random, separate charge, of about $4.50. It turns out they had never actually checked me out, so while I had been staying at (and paying for)another hotel, this hotel had still been charging me. Also sounds like someone maybe charged a drink to the room. The hotel was very nice about refunding the money, but it took a few phone calls, and was stress I didn't need after my brief and unpleasant stay.This is basically an old, budget hotel with fancy water taps and a nice bed installed. I switched to the Hotel Vintage Park, which, when you add in the free wireless internet, was basically the same price. Plus at the Vintage Park they had a free wine reception and a free port reception every night. Really saved on the mini bar bill. Most of all, it was comfortable, inviting, well run and WARM.Bottom line on the Max: Sometimes a bargain is no bargain at all.
