Officially 5 stars - 4 star prices - 2 star standard of rooms

We were looking forward to our stay (after visiting only BBs in OZ) and were very dissapointed.The rooms are out of date, they are dirty, the technoligy (TV etc.) is bad....Don't go, even if you get a good deal (like we did).Only: The Location is perfect for starting the day (ferries etc. nearby).
