Small rooms ... but who cares!

I am originally from Sydney, and make a point of staying at this hotel whenever in Sydney. It cannot be beaten for overall value. There are some other lovely hotels in Sydney eg. W, Park Hyatt (a personal favourite), but the Four Seasons presents the best value without a doubt.The location is great, if you can get a harbour view room on a relatively high floor, you will not be disappointed. Whilst being very used to the amazing service one experiences throughout hotels in Asia, and always being shocked and disappointed when visiting hotels in places like Australia and the US, I find the Four Seasons service to be great - and I am a fussy camper.Yes the rooms are small, and the desk faces the wall, which is never pleasant if you need to do some work in your room, but try to get out and about and enjoy Sydney for what it is. There might not be many TV channels, as mentioned in someone elses review ... but again ... who cares! You shouldn't be in Sydney to sit in your room and watch TV.The down side would be that the rooms are noisy ie. doors closing in rooms next door etc. Many of the staff are knowledgeable and friendly, but not over the top. The room service is excellent ... but do try to get out and enjoy some of the great restaurants within a short walk.
