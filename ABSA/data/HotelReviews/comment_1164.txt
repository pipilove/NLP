did not care

Just come home two day early from this hotel managed to get our travel agent eurostar to bring us home early. Hotels fire sensors going off every 75 seconds outside our room reported this in the afternoon following day when we left about 9.15 following morning sensors still ringing every 75 seconds. My husband and I got no sleep all night and thanks to no rooms being availble thanks to the rugby world cup could not change rooms. Hotel did not seem too bothered that we had to put up with this noise all night. Nice hotel but would not recommend hey do not care about the customer.
