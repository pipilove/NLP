OK But Very Noisy

Overall, an average hotel. Room and bathroom quite small but very clean. My main complaint is the same as mentioned in the previous review. The comparison to Times Square is very appropriate. The area is very touristy, busy and noisy. The street noise lasts well into the morning hours and the double windows don't keep it out of the front rooms. If you're an average to light sleeper, bring earplugs or make sure you get a back room (although not sure even that will do the trick). Although the price is right for Paris, next time I'll return to a quieter area.
