Distinctly Average

Having read the posted reviews, I was somewhat anxious about staying at The Park Hotel. I can only reiterate what others have said: it is certainly NOT 4*, particularly if you are used to North American or British 4* hotels. The standard room we had was adequate but small and would scrape a 3* rating in other countries, while the club room was better, but still only what one would expect of all rooms in such an establishment. We had a problem with very lightweight and unattached bathroom ceiling tiles lifting and the bathroom door opening spontaneously when we had the window open (central heating was stifling) and the duty manager did her utmost to help, finally accepting defeat and offering a room upgrade for our subsequent final night (the hotel being full to capacity and only a very smoky room was our other option). The location is ideal and is only a very short walk from a tram stop served by lines 1, 2  5 which terminate at Central Station. We also encountered staff who could not advise on where to buy a tram strip ticket in the evening: we were told the (closed) tourist office was our only option, while a nearby newsagent sold them.In all, a perfectly decent place to stay, provided you're not planning on spending too much time in your room. I would return, but only if I knew that Le Meridien had engaged in some upgrading of facilities.
