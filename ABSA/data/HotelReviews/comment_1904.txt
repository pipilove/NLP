Nice Hotel but Not Great Hotel

I did alot of research in finding a hotel to stay at since I do our company's travel and accommodation bookings.We were tossing up between 4 Points, Intercontinental and Shangri La and chose 4 Points because of the balcony, locality and reviews from Trip Advisor.The hotel and staff were nice enough but we were disappointed with our suite, which was a Cockle Bay suite with a balcony. As there were 3 of us, one utlised the sofa bed which was very small. The view was lovely but since we stayed at Quay West last time, much preferred the view of the Opera House. Darling Harbour is nice  esp if you have kids but to compare with Circular Quay, would prefer to stay there. We paid more for the suite at 4 Points than for a 2 bedroom at Quay West last year but got an amazing view and huge suite at Q.W. Also the sliding door at 4 Points was so noisy and hard to pull and you didnt have any chairs to be able to sit outside.We were also disappointed as I thought there would have been a nice late night bar with a view as hotels such as Shangri La and Intercontinental had. Although we have a child it was a child free weekend so we were hoping to live it up a bit.I also agree with another review on the shower facilities. For what you pay, rooms need a refurbishment.All in all, we were disappointed but for some I know its a great hotel and understand, just depends on what you like and prefer.
