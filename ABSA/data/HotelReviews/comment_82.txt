Great location but OK room....

Excellent location - Across the street from the Palace and right in the middle of Dam Square and the Red Light District. Close to trams and a 10 walk to Centraal Station and canal tours. Lots of shops, resturants/eateries and bars/coffeshops nearby. A big mall and a grocery store right behind the Palace. About a 15 walk to the Anne Frank House, 20 minute walk from Leidesplein, Vondel Park, the Flower Market, Resturant Row and about a 30 minute walk to the Rijks and Van Gogh Musems.Average looking apartment - The lobby and the shops inside the hotel are nice but my apartment was out back and around the corner, facing the Red Light District where you'll usually pass some shady people selling drugs. Walking up the stairs are extremely steep and the room was average looking (no elevators). There's no AC in the room and the bathroom was pretty small. The washer/dryer was very confusing to use and the dryer took FOREVER to dry clothes. It took me about 6.5 hours to dry a pair of jeans and a couple of t shirts. The Japanese resturant in the lobby of the hotel is very expensive for dinner and the food was just ok. It's supposed to be the nicest hotel in Amsterdam but I've stayed at a Marriott Hotel in San Diego, California that was way nicer.
