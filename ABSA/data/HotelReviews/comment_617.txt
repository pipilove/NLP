Starwood's White Elephant

The best thing about the Westin, as everybody has already stated, is the location. But, this is not the only hotel in the area - The Hilton is just a few blocks away as are a few others that are in the 5 star range.The big problem for me was the fact that the rooms have an ever present sewer smell that hits you as soon as you walk in the room. I was prepared for this as many of the reviewers have mentioned it, but still, it is unacceptable. I was staying here with my Starwood Points, so the room and breakfast were included in the award, but my points are valuable and I felt like I wasted them on this hotel.A curious thing for me was, when I walked outside the hotel, every so often, from Friedrichstrasse to the Brandenburg Gate, that same awful smell would drift by. My take on it is that the sewer system put in by the GDR needs to be replaced. Bottom line: pick another hotel, the Starwood Group has a white elephant on their hands with this smelly grand hotel.
