Great staff, good value

With the exchange rate what it is for us Americans, I was really looking for a good value, and got it at Hotel Nadia. And the staff is very friendly. As you'd expect, the rooms are nothing fancy, but provided a good sleep. I asked for a quiet room, and got it ! Much quieter than expected, given the buzz of the city, cable cars, etc. I liked that the rooms have a frig, TV, safe, and remodeled bathrooms. However, the shower head spray in room 518 is a bit interesting / difficult --- No complaints at all on the WC in the first night's room. (we started and ended our trip with 1-night in Amsterdam); As you have probably already read, there is no elevator. The staff helps with the bags, thank goodness. Please know for older people or those who are not active at all, the stairs can be tiring -- We were on the top floor; that's 73 curvy steps up. At 40 yrs old, I'm glad that I was hitting the gym, before the trip ! Of course there are rooms on lower levels, but still more stairs than one typically climbs in the U.S. It's hard for me to rate it, as my only other hotel experience (over the past 8-yrs) has been at a much more expensive hotel. For this category of hotel, I recommend Hotel Nadia to anyone looking for a value in my favorite city.
