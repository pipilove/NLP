Great location .

We loved the cosy bar ! Hotel Rex is a nice, quiet hotel on Sutter Street, 3' walk from Union square. The hotel is well located for cable car links , financial district and shopping centre of San Francisco.We loved the hotel because it was close (or well linked) to main attractions without having the noise and buzz of a touristic hotel. The breakfast was good and generous (...even though a bit expensive). For a cheaper breakfast, right on the corner of Sutter street there is a diner where classic American breakfast is served. Starbucks coffee is on the corner as well as a 24hour supermarket. The staff was friendly and very helpful. The interior of the lobby was well decorated. The bar's decoration is reminescent of a 1960's living room/office. The rooms were well sized and clean.
