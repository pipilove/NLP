Friendly staff, but.....

My family and I booked three seperate rooms in the new wing. When we arrived, we were told that section was for some reason closed and we were booked into the older section of the hotel. The rooms were extremely small and cramped and the beds very low to the ground and smaller than a normal twin sized bed. The pillows were lumpy and uncomfortable.On the plus side, the hotel staff were all very, very friendly, the location was excellent and the breakfast buffet outstanding.
