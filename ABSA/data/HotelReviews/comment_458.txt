just ok and expensive

stayed for long weekend,hotel just ok,not good not bad .staff very good and nothing is to much trouble.but very expensive to have a drink and unwind here,decore ok,very modern if that is what you like.breakfast very good but be down early or not much left.location is the best thing about hotel and dont be fooled by picture of swiming pool,it is just the size of a large bath.but overhaul not bad
