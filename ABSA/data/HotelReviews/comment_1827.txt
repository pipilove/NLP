Poor &quot;Front Desk&quot; Service

Whilst this hotel is in a good location - within walking distance to Darling Harbour the Front Desk service that I experienced when checking in was extremely poor. A queen bed room was booked but could not be offered to me as they did not have any of these rooms left. When I asked could housekeeping please come up and make the twin beds into a double for us, she rudely said that this could not be done due to the hotel rules, but if I wanted to make it up myself I could - this meant moving side tables, beds and requesting new sheets / doonas etc. - Not a great way to have to start your stay!When we then enquired about car-parking the same lady on reception was once again very rude to us and could not even tell us where we should park - we had to go and locate the concierge ourselves to find this out.The hotel itself is of standard quality, but beginning to show the signs of a needed upgrade.
