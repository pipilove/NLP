booking confirmed - room unavailable on arrival

Although I booked my room through the hotel website, it turned out to be unavailabe when I arrived. I was sent to a nearby hotel (also property of the the Nob Hill owner) with a terrible person at the front desk. In the end, I decided to look for another hotel myself.
