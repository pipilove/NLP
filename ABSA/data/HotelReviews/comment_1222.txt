Overall Happy

Stayed May 2007, in town for business.Room 1300The +:- Great location, close to cable car, shopping, food!- Very pleased with the staff- Nice view, high floor, no significant noise issues - had to close window anyway at nights - chilly!- Free coffee and cookies downstairs in the lobby- Liked the small hotel character and the lack of a huge/commercial lobby- They had accommodated my request for hypoallergenic pillows and high floor (thank you)- Free wireless internet access with no problemsThe -:and Wes, don't get upset please...:-)- moldy smell upon entering the room- room needs updating (I think they are in the process), carpet needs help..., bed headboard needs replacing/cleaning, room needs better electricity plugs and they need to e made more accessible, lamp shades have stains- room needed more dusting, especially the walk-in closet and the bed headboardOverall, I was pleased and loved the convenient location, but I can only give 3 dots (neutral/average), only because of the above negatives. I was there for business and stayed by myself. I would return for a similar trip, but not for a family/couple stay until the renovation is completed. I think when the rooms get upgraded I will be able to give 4 or 5 dots.
