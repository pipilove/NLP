No Style, No Content, Just Noise

The Hotel Max sets itself up as a boutique, chic establishment with the emphasis on style  a bit of cheekiness aimed at 20-30 somethings. Fine if you want to stay the night in an art gallery (a tawdry, uninspired one at that - which is a shame given Seattle's fine artistic reputation) but there are some basics that any hotel needs to provide before the extras are added. My first room, on the tenth floor, was tiny. My suitcase couldn't open fully due to the lack of space between the bed  the wall. More annoyingly there was an air vent attached to the building next door which provided a constant low drone that became disturbing very quickly. I tried to compensate by turning the a/c up but that just increased the amount of rumble as the unit is so old. The manager put me in a larger room across the hall instead. No air vent industrial hum here just excessive traffic noise from Stewart St. There is basically no sound-proofing in this hotel as my investigations into several other rooms proved - you either get the persistent drone of air vents at the back or juggernauts  car horns rattling your windows at the front at all times of the day.One last piece of noise pollution reared it's ugly head later though - the couple next door had clearly found the sex pack (condoms, lubricant, vibrator etc) available to buy in the room  at that point I discovered there was absolutely no sound insulation within the hotel from room to room either. For style  content go to 1000 Hotel on First Avenue - you get peace  quiet too.
