Great hotel

Date 29 feb 2008 Have just got back from berlin and found the agon perfect for a stay, ideal for getting around if you get the u bahn from Samariterstrasse ( 2 mins up the road) to alexandraplatz you can then get anywhere you want to by tram, bus,or rail,get a welcome card it is well worth the money and has a very useful booklet with it. We had a twin room, not huge but decor good and everywhere very clean (you only sleep in it). Breakfast superb- what a choice and staff very helpful. There is a shop on the corner if you turn right out of hotel where you can buy cheap beer, snacks etc. Some nice restuarants nearby too, try Leander and also a bit further away one called Plus minus nil. Would recommend this hotel to anyone it is great value for money.
