A cozy well located hotel

While I would not recommend the Nadia to anyone who is handicapped (very long and steep staircase), hotel prices are high in Amsterdam, and this was one of the better priced 2 star hotels. The rooms were small but clean and well appointed (including fans, which helped when it got hot), and the staff vere very friendly and attentive. We booked directly through their web site, and they responded promptly each time. When we arrived for our return stay of our round trip through Amsterdam, there were flowers in the room and a nice note. The breakfast is basic but adequate. The location is superb, right in the Jordaans district. For the price, I would definitely stay there again, but recommend a room without a view, as they are quieter. Amie Rodnick
