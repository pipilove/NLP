Ideal location

We stayed for three nights prior to embarking on a cruise to Los Angeles. The hotel was part of a Princess pre cruise package but we upgraded to a Harbour View Room. We were on floor 11 and the view was amazing. The hotel was smart and efficient as you would expect. We did not eat in the hotel as we wanted to see and experience as much of Sydney as we could in the short time we were there. The hotel is ideally situated right by Circular Quay for ferrys, Sydney Harbour Bridge Walk, The Rocks, Bus Terminal, Opera House and lots of restaurants and pubs. Our cruise ship also docked within walking distance of the hotel and was in fact parked almost under our window.
