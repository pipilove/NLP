Friendly staff, smelly rooms

The staff at the Nadia Hotel were very friendly  gave us a great overview of the city when we arrived. We were very impressed with how helpful they were  the free breakfast service was also a nice bonus (mostly bread  jams). If you're on a budget, this place is fine. However, the room was clean but smelly (old pipes?) and very small. The door hits the bed and there is little room for suitcases. The location was mediocre - close to the Anne Frank museum and the main canals, but not the best area. I'd recommend spending more and staying closer to the Leidesplien. The Nadia Hotel wasn't terrible, but I would not recommend this place to friends because of the smell  location.
