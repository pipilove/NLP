Poor Service

Stayed at this place based on the reviews of this website - I'm sorry I did. The service was very poor. I arrived at the hotel early in the morning with a confirmed reservation for a certain room type picked out from website. Was told that I couldn't check in yet - which was reasonable since it was before noon. Came back later in the day but was then told, oh sorry that room is not available despite my confirmed reservation and having presented myself earlier in the day?! The only room now is one on the ground floor right off the lobby facing the street (with traffic passing by). Why wasn't I told that when I got there that morning? I would have left and found a different hotel. But obviously when I came back it was too late to find another hotel. Guess they wanted to fill as many rooms as possible and gave mine away to someone who didn't want the lobby room. The attitude of the manager/desk staff was very poor. She half-heartedly tried calling for a cab. When the line was busy after one try she said sorry just find one on the street. Thanks for nothing. I would definitely not stay there again and if you do, don't count on your reservation.
