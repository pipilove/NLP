Disappointing room but great location

Having found this hotel on the tripadvisor website I booked 3 months in advance and asked for one of the nicer more expensive rooms at the top of the hotel with a view as it was to be a birthday treat for my partner. Everything was great; location, cost, breakfast, lovely little lift, friendly staff (hostess a little aloof however), cleanliness of room etc. but the room itself did not live up to the hotel's website pictures or the descriptions on this website. Maybe we were unlucky with room 53 but it was dull and uninspiring particularly given my advance request for something special. I felt I may have been penalised for admonishing whoever took my booking back in July for sending my creditcard details back and forth in an unsecure email. Good value however for a very central location.
