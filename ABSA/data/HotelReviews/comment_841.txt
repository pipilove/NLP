Bleak House OK.

Not sure if we were staying in the same place as some of these other reviews but we were sorely disapointed by this hotel. We tried three rooms before we gave in and settled for a room on the fifth floor. On the plus side it was a large corner room but it was so sparsly furnished that it looked very bleak. A large area had one small chair and a broke-down, tiny table that would have shamed all but the most ill-kempt of patios. Quite what we were supposed to have done in this area was anyones guess. The desk was badly damaged and the walls in all the rooms were in dire need of a lick of paint as they were really heavily marked (a charming if somewhat unsightly reference perhaps to the graffiti which mars the city). Not all of the rooms have fridges, and don't rely on any toiletries (two sachets of some kind of Do-it_All detergent). There are limited tv options for the English speaker (CNN  BBC World)but a hairdryer can be obtained from the grim and spartan lobby which much like the Ku'damm itself has an air of neglection about it. The pleasant girl at reception suggested that we fill in a feedback form, hinting that she and her colleagues were aware of the problems but that management were not. The breakfast is your standard continental affair and the staff do thier best to keep things in order when it gets a bit busy (around 9.15-10.00).All in all, could do better. The shame is that it wouldn't take much, just a lick of paint and some suitable furniture. Instead management seem content to let things deteriorate......pity.
