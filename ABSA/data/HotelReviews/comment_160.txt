Poor value, run-down, breakfast is not great value.

Staff were friendly just don't ask them for a restaurant recommendation, they gave us some very bad choices, obviously some staff were on kick backs from some of the local restaurants. The room are very quiet and clean, but they were run-down. We stayed in the green wing, where the carpet and furniture in the room was very worn. Breakfast was very poor and certainly is not good value for money, I'd recommend that you avoid it altogether and get it in a local cafe.
