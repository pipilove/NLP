Good location

The location is very convenient. Just a block away from the train station and the Canal Bus office. It is also just a few blocks away from the Jordan district where a number of interesting restaurants abound. The lobby of the hotel bodes well but while the room was good size, the carpets and furniture are in need of renewal. It was also unfortunate to learn upon arrival that there was a charge for the fitness room. This is not an uncommon annoyance but should be on the web site.
