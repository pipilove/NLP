Great location, lovely room, nightmare receptionist.

Why hotels allow front of house staff to spoil a stay before it has even started is beyond me. We booked an executive room on the hotels own website for 2 adults and 1 child, selected double bed as opposed to 2 singles with an extra bed in the room. When we arrived the hotel was overbooked and we were given a twin room.We refused to accept it and were flatly told that the hotel did not have any double executive rooms with space for an extra bed to be added at all, ever. We stood our ground refusing to accept that the website would allow us to book such a room if they did not exist in the hotel. After much huffing and puffing we were given the room that did not exist (spooky) and very nice it was too. The room was faultless with a lovely bathroom. At the risk of sounding picky I must just mention that the free mineral water advertised on the website and in the hotel brochure is 6 euros so not sure how that is free!If you can get past the receptionists and get the room you booked I think you will be hard pushed to find fault with this hotel.
