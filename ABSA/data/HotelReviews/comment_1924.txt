Great Location - Ok Hotel

Admittedly, we stayed at some very exceptional properties before we arrived at the Four Seasons in Sydney but I still expected more from The Four Seasons. First off, the rooms are eceptionally small - we're talking NY sized rooms or even smaller. The views were great though- we could see the Opera House and the bridge from our window. The bathrooms are pretty cramped as well and the shower had mold all along the bottom. The location of the hotel is great though - walking distance to major attractions. I was a little put off by a charge of $14 for 7.5 minutes of internet access in their business center - you're already paying a lot to stay there and for them to just charge egregiously for something as cheap as internet access is just inconsiderate to me. Breakfast was good and the selection was varied. One other major problem we had was we used the in-room safe to store valuables (mainly cash and camera) and were in a hurry to make our appointment at the bridge climb. I went to get our camera out and the safe malfunctioned so I called security to override the safe....it turned out that even the override wouldn't work. So we waited and waited and ended up finally just leaving for our big adventure without our camera (I was not happy about this).....the safe was finally opened when we got back but it took them quite some time (well over an hour). This was frustrating and concerning - what is there had been medication in the safe - it could have been trouble. Overall, the location was great but for the price and cramped space, I would try another hotel in the area.
