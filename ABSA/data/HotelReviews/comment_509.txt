An unplesant stay

My girlfriend and I stay in this hotel after returning from a 12 days cruise and were truly disappointed. I had booked this hotel because it was Trip Advisor's 2006 Top Pick. Although I had contacted the general manager and asked for an early check in, we waited until about 1:00 before we were able to check in. We found the lobby to be very shabby and when finally showed to our room there was construction on our floor (which was never disclosed when I contacted the general manager about early check in) The room was especially small, the beds (twins) were pushed up against the window, what I thought was a balcony room ended up overlooking the top of other buildings and the room was really narrow which I understand is typical of European hotel rooms but this was beyond small. The bathroom was so narrow that you couldn't fit two people in it, although that would have been difficult since there was only one sink which kept clogging up. The resturant was not open for dinner and didn't open until 2:00 for lunch, so we were forced to find something else. Although the staff was helpful there seemed to be a lot of confusion when we asked for help. I confirmed out flight for the next day, but found out later, after we arrived at the airport four hours early, that the reservation had changed. We stayed in another hotel the first night we arrived in Barcelona and that was a wonderful experience and were disappointed that this was the way we ended our trip. The most laughable thing was that they allowed one kleenex for two people in a little sample box marked for women, guess the men don't need kleenex. The lights were difficult to figure out, the noise level up to about 6:00 pm was really loud. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. It was truly a disappointment.
