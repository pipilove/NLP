Modern, Well-Run Hotel

This hotel is conveniently situated within short walking distance of the Barcelona Sants railway station offering direct service from the BCN Airport. The hotel is a modern high-rise, with large contemporary rooms, efficient, helpful staff; and the included breakfast in a beautiful 23rd floor setting was among the best we have experienced in extensive European travels. Highly recommended for reasonable cost lodging in an expensive, beautiful city.
