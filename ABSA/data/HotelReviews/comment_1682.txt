A Very Cool Hotel

If you're looking for a cool, offbeat place that also has a sense of humor, The Max is for you.The hotel location, design, vibe and staff are geared towards providing you and your significant other, (but probably NOT your kids) an artistic and somewhat funky place to get back to in between enjoying Seattle.Modern fixturing, tons of original art, a sleek lobby and hip restaurant (which serves great breakfast and even better sushi) left me quite satisifed with my pick.I did not find my room small as some of the reviewers here may have. But even if you find yours a bit cozy I guarantee it will be VERY clean.4 days at the MAX were all great!
