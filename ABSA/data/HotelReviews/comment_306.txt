Doesn't Deserve It's Five-Star Rating.

I am not someone who usually complains, but the Hotel Majestic managed to defeat even my stoic British spirit.Upon arrival, we were ignored as we repeatedly tried to get the receptionist's attention.When we were finally shown to our room on the seventh floor, it was dark, dingy, and slightly dirty in parts. The small window was directly opposite another room's window, which was a mere two metres away, and allowed minimal light through as our view was blocked by walls, drain pipes and gutters. The walls were extremely thin, meaning we could hear every noise the rather passionate couple next door to us were making.The toiletries brought my partner out in a rash, and the bathrobes were so coarse they aggravated my eczema. Our shower kept switching between scalding hot and freezing cold, and the lavatory kept blocking. We had requested a double room, but were met with two (fairly lumpy) single beds. We were told to merely 'push the beds together', and deal with it. Had I not paid over æ‹¢200 a night, I probably wouldn't have minded so much, but as it was, it didn't seem appropriate 5 -Star behaviour.The final icing on the -frankly, rather rotten- cake was that the pool and sun terrace were closed. With such a major part of the hotel out of service, one would expect there to be some notification on the website, and to be reminded of this at check in. However, I have scoured the website and found no such notification, and was certainly not notified of it at reception. Instead, guests are informed of the pool's closure via a small, slightly dog-eared sign in the elevators.My advice to any potential guests of the hotel majestic is this-DON'T LET YOUR HOLIDAY BE RUINED - FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!
