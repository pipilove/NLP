Comfortable, but the rooms are small

We stayed at the Swissotel Amsterdam in June 2004 and were disappointed when we first saw our hotel room. Well, it's not that the room was that bad, but for a reputable 4*+ international property, we had expected better than what we got. The room furnishings looked outdated, although the small lobby looked modern and newly renovated. We were surprised to find that the hotel room was rather small -- the small elevator and narrow corridor to the rooms were hints that the rooms weren't going to be spacious either...almost had a clastophobic feeling. The bathroom door had to be closed all the time or it would block the passage to the main door. On a brighter note, the room was clean and decent. The staff were friendly. The hotel is also conveniently located near the Dam Square and within walking distance to the train station. By the 3rd day of our stay, we'd readjusted our hotel expectations and focused instead on enjoying our tour of The Netherlands.
