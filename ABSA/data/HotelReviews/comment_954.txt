Loved this Hotel...

I had never been to France or even Europe prior to this trip. I had no idea what to expect at all. I did a lot of research and found the reviews to be helpfull. We arrived in Paris and I was in awe, the Albe was a perfect location. The streets aroung the hotel were safe, as I found all of Paris to feel. The direct location of hotel is right on the river sienne, across from the Notre Dame, right in the center of the city. There was good food close by and excellent walking streets, it was definately where the life of the city felt to be. It was extremely loud all night long Saturday night, but the windows did a good job of dampering the noise, however we slept with the windows open. I would highly reccommend to anyone who wants a great location with a lot of action. Will definately stay again.
