Park Inn &quot;Hotel&quot;

I strongly recommend you to go somewhere else if you can. It was the first time in my entire life that I went to a hotel that didn't have a proper bathroom. There is no proper wall between the shower and toilet and the rest of the room. From the aesthetic point of view it's awful.These are my wife's comments. I pretty much agree with them, though personally I think that the lack of auditory privacy is more of a problem. I also found the beds (two single beds together) far too soft, though that's obviously a personal preference. Worse, in my mind, is the fact that a clear space between the two mattresses therefore opens up, because of their softness. We've become accustomed to the two single mattress situation in hotels in Germany and the Czech Republic but this is the first time we've experienced a problem.We booked a business class room, and the hotel management have assured us (twice) that this is the room that in fact we've got. The only difference appears to be that we have marble floors in the shower and a rain shower. But the room couldn't be any smaller and our view is over the building site, rather than over the more picturesque view that (fortunately for us) appears on the photograph facing the bed. Business-class rooms are supposed to have tea and coffee; we had to request that service, but there's almost no room to put the hot water heater.The hotel does indeed provide internet service (which is what I'm using right now), but you should know that (unlike in the other hotels in which we've stayed during this trip) to use it costs 6.5 euros per hour or 18 for 24 hours.To be fair, the room itself (though very small) is clean and functional (if you don't care about privacy). But our bet is that you can do much better in Berlin than stay here.
