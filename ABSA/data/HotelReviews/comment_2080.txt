Great stay - think I scored an upgrade

I spent 1 night at the Amora when on Business. I got a great rate booked through my office and I think I scored an upgrade in the deal - although nothing was said to me at check in. I had a room on Lv 32 on the western side of the building. Very comfortable King Bed with a large picture window. A big comfy lounge chair and a work desk were in the room. a big wall unit contained everything you could want - fully stocked mini bar and tea/coffee making, TV with internet and games, robes, slippers, etc the funny part was the big old boxy TV - still it had perfect reception.the bathroom was large with a big soaking tub up against a picture window - I enjoyed a great soak although you can't see out the window once in the tub. the best part was that there was a TV Volume / speaker in the bathroom. So I soaked away whilst listening to a program. The range of toiletries was great - soap, shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, toothbrush and paste, vanity set with cotton balls, pads, shower cap, sewing kit etc etcHad good lighting for doing my makeup including a magnified shaving mirror on a retractable arm.I used the gym - which was pretty good - good quality machines in perfect order. the room was a bit small and there were no hand weights or fitballs. I had breakfast at the buffet the next morning and that was very good. a bit expensive but they did cook me 2 poached eggs and there was a chef making fresh omlettes to order. check out was very easy I wish I could have stayed longer - very comfortable
