Stay here if you can get a deal

We got a rate of $99 on Priceline. They put us in a hospitality suite with two roll-aways! On the other hand, the cots were comfortable and the room, strange as it looked, was bigger than a regular room. The front desk is disorganized, the lobby is outrageously crowded and bustling with groups.Theres a nice view from the pool/health club. The location is good for touring. Theres no place for breakfast. I would never consider staying here for rack rate but for a priceline stay, it's fine.
