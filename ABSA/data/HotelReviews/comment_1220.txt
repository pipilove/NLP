Great!

I have stayed at the Chancellor on 2 occasions, the last being Feb 2006. I would like to say that I think this hotel is really good. The rooms are kept very clean, nice and bright, beds are comfortable too. This hotel enjoys a great location on Union Square for everything. Very convenient to catch the cable car too. Yes this hotel is old and in my opinion its kept very well by all the staff. The breakfast is excellent in the restaraunt and I can particularly recommend the daily fruit shakes! waiter was also very friendly. There is really only one thing that was slightly annoying.. on my second visit there, after checking in we went to our room and after 45 mins our luggage did not arrive! I called the front desk and was told they were on their way... after a further 30 mins I went down to reception only to find them in the same spot that I left them, right by the front desk so I took them up to the room myself. A minor point I agree, however it was pouring with rain in San Francisco so we were wet and really needed a change of clothes, otherwise I would not have minded this but there was no apology given whatsoever. Besides this, I would have no hesitation in staying here again on my future visits to SFO. Thanks... manager and staff do a great job - keep it up!
