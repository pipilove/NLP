Find another hotel, this is at best a three star hotel with 5 star price

I ordered a superior room for three nights in late May 2005, at the Majestic, assuming this hotel really was a 5 star hotel. Arriving at this hotel from another 5 star hotel near by we expected at least the same service, quality and professional staff. But NOT. After complaining we got a upgrade to a premier room (712) , not nearby 5 star hotel quality at several hotels I have visited before.The facts: Price: We paid about 400 Euro for a small, stinky room, with a small bathroom. Poor quality furniture, but it had a good view from the balcony.A lot of traffic noise from 0530 in the morning. We had to have the window open since the smell from the air condition system was really terrible. Since the hotel was prepaid they even refused to let us get anything back if we moved from the hotel after check-in, even if we complained promtly. We asked for a refound for at least 1 night, but the refused even this.Faced with a bill at about 1200 Euro for three nights, we felt like we had to stay there.So; If you are looking for a 5 star hotel experience, this is not the place.The only 5 star about it is the price.So my message is clear: Stay away from the Majestic, this is a rip-off with their Majestic fantasy prices, arrogant staff and stinky rooms. We came from the Casa fuster 5 star hotel 500 m away (a real 5 star hotel). This hotel was compared with the Majestic absolutely fantastic. Cheaper, better and the service and friendlyness of the staff was superb.T.Ellefsen, Norway
