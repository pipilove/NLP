Solid Choice

Stayed 3 nights in March. All amenities associated with a good business hotel at an above average level. Excellent fitness room, though I did not use the spa/pool.Great location, a short walk to shopping  many popular points of interest (e.g. Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag, museums, checkpoint charlie). U-bahn station directly in front of hotel for easy transport to attractions farther west.Note breakfast and 24-hours of Internet use were an extra 22 euro each.
