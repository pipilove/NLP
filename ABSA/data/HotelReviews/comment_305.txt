Not Good

I was very much looking forward to my stay at the 'five star 'Hotel Majestic but from the minute I arrived I was underwhelmed. I booked directly with the hotel and paid extra for a room with a balcony. The room itself was fine, nothing special but fine, however when I went out on the balcony I was extremely disappointed. Not only was it shabby and a little bit grubby looking but there were these awful large bolts and screws exposed all along the wall, which not only looked unsightly but could also have easily caused a nasty scrape. We informed reception who came and had a look at the exposed bolts but didn't actually offer to do anything about them. The hotel's roof top terrace is tiny and only has about 7 or 8 sun loungers so unless you are up there first thing in the morning you can forget about it. The final straw came when I requested an additional sun lounger for our private balcony (as there was only one on it). The girl at reception reluctantly agreed to check 'if it was possible' and said she would call me back to let me know. I sat waiting for 30 mins with no repsonse. At this stage I had had enough. So we packed our bags, checked out and went to another hotel. When we were checking out they did apologise and offered to upgrade us to a suite but by that stage I just wanted to get out of there. However they did charge us for the one night we stayed. It is possible that we were just unlucky with the room we were given but overall I expect alot more from a 5 star standard hotel. The atmosphere in the hotel is pretty stade and the staff are not the friendliest. I wouldn't recommend this hotel.
