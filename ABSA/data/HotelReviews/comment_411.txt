Overall, a great place to stay

We stayed here for two nights, either side of one night in Perpignan, and were overall very satisfied with the place.The price (EU.101) per night was excellent value for money, compared with many equivalent hotels. The staff were helpful and friendly, the rooms and bathrooms were clean well maintained and it was in short walking distance to Las Ramblas and the main tourist drag.(Limited) Parking is available underneath the hotel. It's a very inconspicuous entrance so don't miss it (like we did...) or you'll end up doing a big loop (like we did...) Parking costs about EU. 21 per night, which is a bit steep but not unexpected, and you will need to check availability first.The view from our first room was ok, 6th floor view onto the main street below. The second room at the back of the hotel was not so good, a decent sized balcony but looking straight into the backs of residential apartments. As we were on a four man boys weekend away, such things didn't really matter, but if I were to have gone with my wife and son, I would probably have asked if another room was available.The swimming pool on the roof is a gem. Only small, but a good place to chill out, and the views of Barcelona are fantastic. We didn't sample the breakfast, so can't comment on the food.Over, I would recommend this as a place to stay if visiting this great city.
