below average Hilton

We stayed at Hilton Berlin in early June, 2006. We are Diamond HHonor memebers, so were upgraded to executive room on the executive floor. The room is average looking, with motel style bedspread and decrative pillows. underneath the bedspread, there are 2 twin comforters, which is wierd for a queen room. Bathroom is average looking too, with mold smell. concierge not helpful and very unfriendly. executive floor representitives are cold too. we stayed at many hiltons worldwide, we feel this is a below average hilton, especially for it's service. we defintely will try other hotels when we return to berlin next time.
