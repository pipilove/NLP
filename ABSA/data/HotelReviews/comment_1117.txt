Excellent Rating??

My husband and I stayed at the Bassano for about a week in July. We picked this hotel based off the TripAdvisor ratings and I must say I was really dissappointed. This was our last stop on a 2 month European trip and it was the only hotel that didn't live up to its great reviews. There wasn't anything terribly wrong with the hotel but I defineltly wouldn't rate it as the best hotel in Paris.I would say that if you are a frequesnt traveler to Paris and need no assistance from the hotel staff (i.e. restaurant  sightseeing recommendations, tickets etc.) then this hotel is very centrally located and easy walking distance to the underground. Other than that I really wouldn't recommend this hotel for families or first time tourists who need some assistance in planning out a day of sightseeing or restaurant recommendations.
