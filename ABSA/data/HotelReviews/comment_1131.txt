Let the magic begin..

We have just returned from five magical days in Disneyland Paris. We travelled with three children age two, five and six. From the moment we arrived we had five star service..the star are so accommodating and friendly, true service with a smile. We had two interconnecting rooms located in one of the turrets of the pink palace. our rooms where spotless, and we had bed turndown service at night. Breakfast is fit for a king, well presented and great choice and also the added benefit of meeting the characters one to one. Dinner for the children is expensive for what is on offer you are better going to Disney Village. The park was decorated for Christmas, and it was just awesome, walking down Main Street USA with the Christmas carols being sung and the snow coming down(virtual snow.. it is Disney after all)had me almost crying, my childrens eyes where out on sticks in awe of it all...It is the place where fairytales begin.
