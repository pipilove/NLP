Liars- Bait and Switch Operation

The night before we were scheduled to check in at this hotel, I called to confirm our reservations. The person at the hotel told me that Travelocity sent them a fax saying we had backed up our reservation to come in 2 nights later and that they were booked the night I was scheduled. When I asked them to fax me a copy of this fax they refused to do so. I then called Travelocity who called the hotel for me and came back saying that the hotel said we changed the reservation. Total Lie! I had never called this hotel before this moment. Travelocity then told us they had to talk to the Managers and would call us back by 11pm Central Time. We never received a call back, so we called again. They got back in touch with the hotel and said we could check into their sister hotel. Luckily I read in a previous post that this hotel was awful. We said that was not acceptable and Travelocity said they would book us another room (at the same rate we were scheduled to pay at another hotel). So we picked another hotel that was a little more expenisive and they still charged our card the higher rate. And took until 2 am on the phone to get another hotel (we could have rebooked one ourselves quicker if we knew we were going to pay a higher rate).My guess is the Nob Hill overbooks and takes the people who received the cheaper rates online and trys to bump them to their worse hotel. Oh and The Travelocity Guarantee is not a guarantee.
