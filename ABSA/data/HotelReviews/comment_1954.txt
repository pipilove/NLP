Great location, ok hotel

My husband and I spent one week at this hotel. We had booked a flight+hotel package from a travel website and requested a swiss advantage room, which was supposed to be a room on a higher floor.The taxi dropped us outside the hotel, and immediately a bellboy came to help. The reception is on the 8th floor and we got our room keys promptly. The room was paid for but we were of course asked for a credit card for the extras.Our room was situated on the 23rd floor, executive floor, but we did not have access to the executive lounge.The room was odd-shaped, and overlooked a massive construction site. It was extremely noisy that afternoon, but thankfully it got more quiet the next day.Maybe because it was around christmas?The Internet connection was not working for the 1st day and we thought almost 30AUS$ for a 24h connection was a rip-off.During our week-long stay in the hotel, none of the bell-boys greeted us on the way in or out. The staff (technicians, housekeeping) we met on our floor would not even look at us! The housekeeping was the best, our room was always spotless and our amenities refilled. Once though, I called the room from the outside hoping to talk to my husband and it was the maid who answered saying no one was there!We had room service one night. An ok club-sandwich and the most awful spaghetti with meatballs I've ever seen. They even smell disgusting...We didnt try any restaurant or bars.I would only recommend this hotel for the location, super central, and next to many shops, the harbour, chinatown,...One more thing, we could not believe that we were charged an extra 1.5% on the bill because we used a VISA credit card!
