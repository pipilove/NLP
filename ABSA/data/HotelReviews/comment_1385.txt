Loved the Tuscan Inn!!!

We stayed at the Tuscan Inn in August while visiting San Francisco. We would highly recommend this hotel, on arrival we were given an upgrade to a junior suite which was perfect after a long flight from the UK.We found the staff extremely helpful and the room was clean , tidy , a decent size and the bed was extremely comfortable.Would definately recommend this hotal as the location is perfect , only afew blocks from Fishermans Wharf.Thanks for a great stay !
