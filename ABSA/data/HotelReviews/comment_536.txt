Good not great

We stayed at the Jazz for a family break having read the reviews on Tripadvisor. Had 2 rooms - a double and a triple corner suite (for the kids). Nice modern decor. Staff helpful (ordered a 7 seater taxi etc) and spoke good English. The location is good and if you have a skateboarder in the party (as we did) it is very convenient for several of the better spots (MACBA, Universitat, one stop on metro to Paral.lel, etc). The position is a bit noisy and the breakfasts are quite expensive (though very good as well). So overall, we thought it was a good choice but not the best ever. We'd use it again.
