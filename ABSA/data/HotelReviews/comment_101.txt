Hotel from Hell . . .

We had booked a 'split-level suite' at an exorbitant, non-refundable rate. A steep staircase connected the upper and lower tiny rooms. There were no reading lights, a non-working TV, no door to the toilet, no carpets, etc. We complained and were switched to a smelly smaller room (same price). As we went to bed later that evening, we discovered that our feet were now wet from vomit next to the bed, vomit which had not been cleaned up by housekeeping. We were switched to a third (clean) room the next morning and given a 25% discount and free breakfast. The breakfast room was dreary and reminiscent of Soviet-era style service and food. To add insult to injury, when we came home we realized that we had been double-billed on our credit card. Our advice: stay away!
