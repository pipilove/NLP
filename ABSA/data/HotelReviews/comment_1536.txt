Very poor service

After seeing a large renovated suite in this hotel, we booked months ahead so our daughter and her friends could see a concert there. We confirmed it a week or so before our arrival. When we got to the front desk, we were told that we didn't have a reservation and that that room was booked. We later learned that someone else had wanted the room for the whole weekend, so they had given it to them and shafted us, and were lying. They ended up giving us two smaller rooms instead, one renovated where the kids stayed, and one that had not been renovated. Had difficulty locking the door to one room, lock seemed out of alignment. My wife hated the room. There seemed to be drag racing on the street outside until late in the morning, she had trouble sleeping. The teenagers, on the other hand, were happy, and ate at the Crocodile down the street, while we went to Momma's Mexican a few blocks away. Neighbourhood is dicey, but so is the whole of this area, no unpleasant encounters, though many homeless people. Parking is terrible, expensive. .
