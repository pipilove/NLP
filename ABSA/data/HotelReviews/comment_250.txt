Trouble in paradise Swiss Hotel was awful

The Swiss Hotel is very centrally located and hence the price. My wife and I stayed for three nights. The superior room was very small and would be comparable to a good three star hotel.Whilst it was generally clean there were the odd things that would put you off.  - Food from someone's room service was lying in the corridor that must of fell off from the cleaning and was left all day.- The noise from the outside extraction fans for the buildings air conditioning was very loud. - My wife found a pubic hair in the freshly made bed. - I was expecting a queen sized bed (as advertised) and what we got was two single matresses pushed together with a big ridge down the middle of the bed. - The bathroom was so small that you very nearly bang your elbows moving around it. I also found the finishing around the bath was a little dirty/tatty.I made a complaint to the manager about the matress and the fact that I had paid for a superior room and was expecting a decent bed and they point blank refused to give me any discount. They apologised but it was still an awful hotel.Would not recommend this hotel, definately not worth the money, avoidlike the plague.
