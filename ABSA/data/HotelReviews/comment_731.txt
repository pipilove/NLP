Poor bathroom

We had no major issues with the hotel itself but the major problem with the room was the bathroom or the lack of it. The layout of two cubicles (one shower, one WC) and a sink in the room undoubtedly saves space and looks modern but creates a few problems. You had better be very friendly with your room-mate as the toilet and shower are practically next to the bed and there is no privacy at all. Our open plan shower over-ran into the room causing a flood each time it was used - not unusual to have a flooded bathroom floor in a hotel but when this is also your bedroom floor you have a bit of a problem. We were on the 32nd floor of the hotel and had a great view over the old east side of the city. The hotel can be seen for miles around so finding it is no problem.The immediate location of the hotel on Alexanderplatz is convenient to access Berlin's excellent but sometimes confusing transport systems. The TXL airport bus will get you to and from the airport for 4 Euros (remember to buy and validate your ticket as we were asked for them by plain clothed inspectors). There are a few nice shops, a Burger King and a large department store only a few steps from the hotel but you might find a longer journey is required to get a nice meal. Overall the location is too far away from the main sights and shopping areas of Berlin which are mainly in the old west side.
