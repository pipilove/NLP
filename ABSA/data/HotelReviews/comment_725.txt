Strange Shower Arrangements

Stayed in this hotel recently. Situated in east Berlin right on the slightly seedy square . The hotel staff are very effecient and friendly. Food in the restaurant is reasonably priced and very good. The twin bedroom turned out to be a double with two duvets. The en suite consisted of a washhand basin in the room partitioned off from the shower and wc by semi-opaque glass - an astonishing arrangement which gives little or no privacy. Shy couples beware! Great views from the rooms don't really compensate.
