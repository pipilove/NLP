Worst hotel I have EVER STAYED in in the entire world

I booked this hotel through lastminute.com.au and it was a mystery hotel.As I have previously booked using lastminute and had a pleasant experience, i was expecting to find similar quality hotels or at least a reasonable room with a reasonable shower facility. We had no HOT water (and it was cold then in Australia) and the room can't be locked from the adjoining room next door. YET, we were not able to change to another room. It was worse than the backpackers I had stayed in in remote China. The service was rude and extreme patronising especially from the duty manager.We had to wait for more than 2 hours for the hot water to come through before we could take a shower at around 2 am after we came back from visiting some mates, and was told by the duty manager very rudely the next morning that it was normal. He was extremely rude and did not trust our words nor the report of his own staff the night who filed a report. I find his manner extremely condescending towards Asians and he treated my partner better after realising he was white. I didn't expect to find racism in a hotel that services overseas clients and it was shocking the way I was treated. I will not be recommending anyone to stay there ever.
