The worst hotel I have ever stayed at....

This has to be the worst hotel in Sydney. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Rooms are tiny and look nothing like the photos on the website. My husband and I tried to have a romantic weekend together there and booked a suite. The suite had horribly old carpet, and a horribly old smell to go with it, and the view was of a brick wall. So we moved - to a higher floor - and it was a shoebox. The pool area was very average. They staff were rude. We checked out after one night and went home. We've stayed at the Westin in Sydney many times before that and many times since and that is by far and away a superior hotel. We have stayed at the FS Los Angeles (South Doheny Drive), FS Maldives at Kuda Huraa, FS Bahamas, FS Jackson Hole, FS Arizona and FS Whistler, and I was shocked at truly how appalling this hotel really was. It is the old Regent Hotel (which it was prior to FS purchasing the property) and it has not been updated since the 80's. I can understand a hotel not being updated, however, this needs to be reflected accurately in photos and the price needs to reflect this also.
