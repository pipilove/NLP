Shopaholic's best bet

I would say the service at the front desk wasn't terribly warm, but was professional and was left alone for the bigger part of my stay (4 nights) and that suited me fine. The guy at the conceirge was quite helpful and let me use his computer to do an internet check-in while we were waiting for our transport to take us to the airport. He even printed out a copy for me without asking! I'm sorry I couldn't remember his name. Were so flustered as we were running late. Really pleased with the room. 2 double beds! So it was really comfortable with good mattresses (one of the most impt things abt rooms I stay in). Not too much of a view, but then wasn't in the hotel that much to notice (could see Sydney Tower where we were). Too much to do in Sydney. But the room was a haven to get back to after a long day of walking around. In terms of cleanliness, comfort, it was to be expected of a 5-star hotel. Slightly bigger than average for a city hotel.You get a very central location, right beside Sydney Tower, walkable to most shopping areas, including the Woolies that closes at midnight (or smthg like tt), to catch last minute shopping when most other shops are closed. Near the monorail and train stations, with Myers and David Jones at the doorstep. Also near Macdonald's and Burger King which are 24 hours if you get hunger pangs and are sick of room service.The rate was slightly less than S$300, when the rate was 1.3, but was still a bargain as most 5-star hotels cost more than that.
