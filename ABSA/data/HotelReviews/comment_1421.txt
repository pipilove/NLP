Great location, but bring your earplugs

Just got back from a 3-day stay at the Parc 55. The hotel is in a great location near the Powell Street cable car stop. The room was decent too. The only big problem was the noise. The walls are paper thin! I could hear every single word the people next door said. After a couple of hours, I went down to the lobby and asked to be switched to a new room. Same problem with the new room... I could hear my new neighbor's entire conversation. I switched rooms AGAIN and the third room was fine. Make sure you don't get a room with an adjoining room! The staff was nice about changing my room- they probably get this complaint often...
