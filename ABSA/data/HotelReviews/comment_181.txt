Great weekend - Feb 05 Good hotel, good location.

A bit worried about our room on 1st impression (smallish, ground floor, on street) but v comfortable and no problem from street noise.The concept here from the operators is clearly to spend cash on the decor, fittings etc and chuck in things like free room drinks and bar but save on the staffing; usually there was one receptionsist who doubled up making sure the bar was stocked with drinks and nibbles, and a guy who came round clearing up empty glasses etc and that's all the 'front of house' staff there were. Plus no restaurant apart from breakfast. I think on the whole it works, although it is dependent on the quality of what staff there are. One receptionist was very pleasant and helpful, the other less so, although both very knowledgeable, and you should definitely go to the Dutch restaurant they recommend round the corner. Mustard soup - fantastic!I would definitely go again.
