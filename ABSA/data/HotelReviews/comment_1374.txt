4 nights no sleep

We stayed in this hotel from 10-14 October 07 and did not get a full night's sleep in that time. The weekend nights were horrendous, we were kept awake for nearly 2 hours each night with the noise of what we assume were people leaving local clubs. As a result we were too tired to enjoy our visit to San Francisco and have decided never to go there again. I also found the room was much too small with a tiny closet and nowhere to store luggage, and the restaurant to be expensive, particularly when you share the very limited space with the bar and cannot enjoy your meal without noise. The only good thing about our stay in this hotel was the nightly wine reception but that certainly was not enough to make up for the down sides. My advice is if you like your sleep do not stay at this hotel.
