Great service and comforable room

I truly enjoy my 4 nights there. Though it is a bit pricey, it worths every penny. The room is superb. Most staff are very friendly and accommodating. I really appreciate that they allow an early checkin, which is 10am in the morning. It is so helpful to travellers who just went through a long overnight flight. I have to say that the service I got here is way better than the Peninsula in Bangkok, where the infrastructure is brilliant but the service is just average. Breakfast was included in the booking and the place is quite impressive. Pick a window seat and enjoy the lovely park view. I particularly like the abundant choices of juice. The only negative feeling is I found some Asian staff a bit cool. During my check-in the lady at the counter rarely smiled. And when I enquired my phone bill, she gave me am impatient answer. I am also an Asian and I find it very strange. After all, it is just tiny thing and I would definitely return when I visit Sydney next year.
