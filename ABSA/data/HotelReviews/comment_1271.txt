Not bad, not bad...

Stayed at the Castle Inn the night of March 7th, 05. Chose it based on the many reviews it has received on this site. Needed a place to crash after the Dear Friends: Music from Final Fantasy concert. Nice little motel, quite good for the money. I'm not too picky about things, so the Castle Inn pleased me.Pros:-Queen Bed-TV-A/C-Microwave-Mini Fridge-Very clean room-Shower was very clean, water temp was perfect, shower head had good pressure.-Iron and Ironing Board (Girlfriend loved that)-Free Parking (everywhere else charged $25 extra! The parking garage is quite small, I sort of had a hard time maneuvering my little hatchback around in it.)-Less than a block from Walgreens!-Lady at front desk helping with directions (even though she was off by a couple blocks on the destination. No big deal. Nice of her to help!)-Low Price! (about $75!)Cons:-Pillows and bed were hard. I wasnt bothered by it too much, but my girlfriend is picky about what she sleeps on.-Only got two matchbook size bars of soap and two small lipstick size tubes of shampoo for two people to shower and wash with.-TV remote didnt work. No biggie.-Too few towels. Towels were sort of rough.-All the fruit was gone from the Continental Breakfast-Could hear neighboring rooms' toilets flushing during the night. Woke me up a couple times.I'd definitely consider staying at the Castle Inn again, especially if the prices stay the same. Nice room for the money!
