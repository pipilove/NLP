Very Average

We have just gotten back from a 3 night stay at the hotel max after going to Seattle for a friends wedding. The hotel was average at best.. the Queen room was very small with not much room to get around the bed and a very tiny bathroom. The main gripe we had about the hotel was the noise, we were up on the 6th floor, however the traffic noise was still pretty bad and we were woken up at 4:30 the one morning with the aircon above dripping water on our aircon unit (think big raindrops on a tin roof). The airon itself sounds like a industrial fan and given that you can't open windows due to traffic noise doesn't help induce a peaceful nights sleep.the WIFI internet at the hotel is a complete rip-off ($12 for 24hrs) and given that there is free internet in the 'business centre' downstairs I don't see why they can't just throw this in with the room price which isn't exactly a bargain.Good points: The hotel was very clean when we stayed there and they were helpful enough to bring up some headache pills after I came down with food poisoning. The location is also pretty central with decent shops around 5 mins away.If you're stuck for a hotel at a decent(ish) price this isn't bad but do some research as my friend who got married stayed at the Andra hotel and his room looked ALOT nicer.
