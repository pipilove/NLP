Great hotel for the price

Booked this hotel last minute due to overbooking at our other accom in Paris and was very impressed, the room was a little small but still plenty of room for two. Everything was spotless, the check in and out very speedy. The guy on reception was very very helpful. overall I would have no problem recommending this great little hotel in an excellant location.
