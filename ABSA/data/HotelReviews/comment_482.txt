Nice, new hotel.

We stayed in Barcelona for three days during our European honeymoon. The hotel is very new and is quite nice and the staff is well informed and friendly. There are advantages to staying in a new hotel as it does not exhibit the kind of wear and tear that is quite common in numerous luxury European hotels. The hotel upgraded us to a nice corner room and had a bottle of champagne on ice and chocolate covered strawberries in our room. A nice touch, which we appreciated. The only bummer, which to my surprise, was not noted in any previous reviews, is that the hotel is somewhat isolated. It is a 10-15 minute walk to any restaurants and shops. Not a huge distance, but there are many other hotel options that are located right in the thick of things, which is my preference. Plus, sometimes you just want to walk out to get a quick snack or buy a newspaper and hotels in Europe generally do not have gift shops. I would consider staying here again, and would recommend it if you don't mind the location, but would probably stay closer to all the action next time.
