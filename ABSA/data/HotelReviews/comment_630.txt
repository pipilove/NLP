Beware Hotel's Charges

Hotel is well-situated near main attractions, restaurants and shopping. Room was clean, well furnished and serviced promptly. The room air conditioning had a hard time keeping up with the warm temperatures in Berlin. The restaurant (Mark Brandenburg) was over-priced and had marginal food. The hotel was overrun with meetings and groups.There was an unexplained, additional Hotel charge of 8 Euros that appeared on my credit card statement. I challenged the charge in an e-mail to the hotel, and followed up with e-mails to the Hotel (twice), HiltonHonors and Hilton corporate. None of these Hilton entities have had the courtesy of even responding (no less reversing this charge) in over a week.
