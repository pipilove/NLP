Small but perfectly formed

I have been coming to Amsterdam every week for some months now with work. It's been the Easter holidays so I've found many of the hotels booked out.I had been checking Tripadvisor and Hotel Nadia was quite high up the list. I like my creature comforts when I'm away and to be honest with you, my heart sank when I walked up to the front of the hotel, it didn't look great... I always think you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover though.The people on reception were very friendly and helpful. The room was small, and a little noisy (it was at the front of the hotel next to the main road), if you get a chance ask for a room with a canal view as it will be on the side of the hotel where there's less traffic.Other than being small the room had everything you'd need, there was also free wi-fi which is hard to find in Amsterdam. It's really close and easy to walk to Centraal Station as well as all of the tourist spots nearby.All in all a very pleasant (and cheap) stay, I'm sure I will be back there.
