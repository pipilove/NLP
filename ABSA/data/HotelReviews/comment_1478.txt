nice hotel, overpriced

I got a special rate for a conference at this hotel... really the rate was not all that special at $279/night. And I was disappointed to have to pay $12/day for the gym... a tiny, cramped, 2-room gym w/ old equip and only 3 elliptical machines. The hotel is beautiful in the lobby area and some of the larger conference rooms are very ornate. Don't get me wrong, it was a nice room, comfy bed and nice shower... I'm just glad my company was paying. For my money, I would have tried to find a better value. Although, I'm pretty sure that the rate has something to do with the Union Square location as well.
