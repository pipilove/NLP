The worst hotel

We were given an executive room. I can only say this is the smallest room I have ever been given. It was dark, with no views to speak of. I can only assume that this was a broom cupboard which had been converted to a room. The receptionist said that breakfast was not included even though it was. I had to find my booking to show him it was.I could not bear to spend one night in that awful room. Inspite of having paid a package for 3 nights, I had to leave and paid for a room in Le fouquet, which was great.I am extremely surprised about the reviews I read in tripadvisor. I am 62 and have been all over the world. I have never seen such a bad shoddy excuse for a room.There is no way on earth this could be describe as a 5 star hotel. More like the worst 3 star hotel I have seen.
