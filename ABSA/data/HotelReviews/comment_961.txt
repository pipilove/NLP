Just returned from a few days in Paris staying at this excellent establishment - couldn't fault it. Only a few steps from the metro/RER and just about everything else on the doorstep. Although I'd read Trip Advisor reviews before booking through Expedia I was pleased to find it was all true. Brilliant holiday and when I return to Paris, I shall certainly return to this hotel.
