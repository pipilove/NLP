Disappointed

We stayed at the Ares Eiffel after seeing all the enthusiastic reviews posted here. It seemed ideal for our purposes - a romantic and vaguely touristy getaway weekend. We returned feeling pretty disappointed.The staff were pleasant enough, and the location of the hotel is not bad - very close to the local Metro station and not too far from some of the more inviting areas, though there is little of interest in the immediate environs of the hotel. However, in other respects the hotel did not live up to expectations.The main problem was that it was noisy. Street noise was audible throughout the day and night, and the glazing seemed completely inadequate. So was the sound insulation between rooms. We were able to hear absolutely everything happening in adjacent rooms - including the actual words our neighbours were saying, rather than merely the fact they were talking. This was very disturbing. While we may have been unlucky with who we had staying on both sides of us, we could certainly have expected more in the way of soundproofing. It's pretty embarrassing when you hear your neighbour using the bathroom. The decor was quite stylish, and the bathroom was well equipped. The room was microscopic, but comfortable enough, with a decent bed, climate control and a posh TV. The minibar from which you can take as much as you like for 5 Euro a day also seemed a good initiative. However, this was far from the restful and romantic spot we'd been hoping for. I am mystified that, at the time of writing, this is the top-rated hotel in Paris.
