Good location, service surly

After reading all the great reviews of this hotel, we decided to stay here for 4 nights instead of our corporate travel agency's recommendation (Novotel Les Halles). We are here in Paris for business and leisure (with 2 little kids in tow). First the location is awesome, just tremendous (it doesn't hurt that the weather has been wonderful!). Our room on the fifth floor has a cute balcony with a view of the Seine (if you turn your head a bit) and a view of the cafes below. The room itself is 2.5 stars - tight, cramped, average-motel-quality linens/blankets, basic furniture. Bathroom has nice fixtures (Hansgrohe - I just finished a bathroom remodel which explains this observation) and is clean. The Wi-Fi is not free - costs 5Euro for 45 minutes!!! (better hurry up and type). There is only one desk attendant at any one time - so don't expect a porter to help with luggage (they don't offer either). The daytime attendant is nice enough, but sold me a 2-park Disney pass (the other Disney Studios is barely open - everything is in construction) which cost me an extra 30 Euros (The guy gets a 7.5% commission). The night-time attendant is just surly - if you get a nod or a grunt of acknowledgement, you are lucky.Skip the breakfast, the bakery right downstairs is great - it opens at 7am though.If you are a runner, you are in luck, because the Seine is right next to the hotel, and there are some beautiful running paths along the water.
