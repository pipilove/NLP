Just okay

I vacationed in Barcelona for 4 days and stayed at the Gran Torre Catalunya. Most of the reviews are fairly accurate. The hotel is close to a metro, clean, friendly staff, etc. However, please keep in mind the hotel is not unique and has no character whatsoever. The walls are very thin and inside the room can be very noisy. Most of the disturbance is caused by the cleaning staff which makes it difficult to sleep in. The hotel is also close to one of the major train stations so there is also a lot of traffic noise, sirens, etc. which one can hear from the room 22 stories high. Price makes this hotel attractive and one of the main reasons it's ranked so high on tripadvisor. However, I think you can do better as far as location. I would recommend staying in Barri Gothic region of the City. Front desk is very knowledgeable and gives great suggestions on tapas bars, siteseeing and shopping. I strongly would suggest staying this hotel as a 2nd choice.
