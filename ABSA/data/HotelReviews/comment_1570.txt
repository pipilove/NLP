The Hotel is in a great location. Staying on the club floor we got an awesome continental breakfast. The fruit selection was outstanding. I dont know how people can say the Health Club was nice. It is in need of a serious upgrade. Treadmills were in very bad need of repair. (all of them)...The room was very small. If 8-10 people were in there, forget about working out. The jacuzzi was hot and did not work well if at all. The pool was average at best.Rooms were nothing special.The location (awesome) and the breakfast (awesome) raised this hotels grade to average to me. There is no way I would pay anything over 200 a night to stay here. There are many other quality hotels in all aspects for near that price.
