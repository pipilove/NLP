Geat stay at the Mediterrean

The Mediterrean is located close to Seattle Center and the Space Needle. It is only rated a 2star. It must be because there is no AC or restaurant attached. However, there is an attached Starbucks and the coffee aroma is great, esp in the AM. There is a nice roof top garden...Starbucks and a view!! What could be better. This was a great moderately priced hotel, that deserves a better rating. Clean rooms, efficient staff, prompt elevators. Nice decor, charming lobby and exterior. Stay there if you can.
