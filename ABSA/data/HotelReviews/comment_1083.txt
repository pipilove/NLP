Roaches?

We booked this hotel because of the high ratings on Trip Advisor. While it did live up to what many people have written about in terms of the recent remodeling, our big problems was probable tiny roaches! On our first night, we accidently turned the fan/air conditioning (?) on, and we later noticed bugs that appeared to be tiny roaches on the ceiling and one later on the bathroom floor -- for a total of 5-6. The second night, we left the fan off and the window cracked open, and no bugs...We also requested the rooms on the 4th and 5th floor mentioned in previous reviews, but they couldn't guarantee it. We ended up getting a 2nd floor room (224?), which had a nice view of the Eiffel Tower when we leaned out the window, but not like the others.The hotel is in a great location, as people mentioned -- a 10-15 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower, 5 minute walk from the Ecole Militaire metro stop, and 7 minutes from Rue Cler which has great places to eat. But, the night we had difficulty sleeping because we were afraid the bugs would fall on us kind of outweighed the positives.
