Park across the street - smell the glove!

Park across the street, $6 for 24hrs on weekends, $35+ at the hotel. Check-in was efficient, mechanically so, but painless. Stayed in the old tower 10th floor. Nize size rooms with adequate bath. Quiet, comfy bed. However, room smelled like wet-dog a bit. The tub also had long black hair stuck to it (gross). Location is perfect for that part of the city , close to all. I would stay there again at deal rates but would probably ask for new tower to hopefully avoid odor which was not offensive enough to change rooms but a little yucky!
