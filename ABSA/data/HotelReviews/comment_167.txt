A tale of two rooms

Having stayed at the Victoria Hotel, I now understand why the reviews are so mixed. While my husband and I stayed in a small, dark room (one chair, no desk, no room to swing a cat), with no view, our friends had a room at least twice the size for the same price! The public areas are very nice and the staff are very pleasant but the rooms let it down badly. The decor is rather shabby, the furniture doesn't match and the bathroom was so small you had to get dry in the bath. This is not a four star hotel by any stretch of the imagination.
