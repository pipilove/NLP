We haven't even stayed there yet and have been treated like dirt!

I just booked our room on hotwire and was disappointed as soon as I saw the hotel. It looks old and not well kept. I called to see what type of room we would be receiving and the operator treated me like I was a homeless person begging for a room instead of a paying guest. I am absolutely sick that we are now stuck at this hotel.
