Nice and clean, but not worth their five stars

I stayed for two nights together with my mother, as we were visiting friends in Berlin. We booked this hotel partly because of the good reviews it has received here, and partly due to its location, which couldn't be better, right in the centre of town. All the staff were very nice, but I think the standard of the our room was below my expectations for a five-star hotel, with very thin pillows and only one spare pillow. There was no soap in our bathroom when we arrived, and only one bathrobe and one pair of slippers (we did after all have a double room), which was quickly rectified when we alerted the staff to it, but they did seem to find it very odd that we wanted two robes. The breakfast was good, but so I find most hotel breakfasts in Germany. The hotel also provides complimentary internet access to guests (behind the concierge), which was very convenient, since we wanted to check in online before leaving the hotel for the airport. I found the Swissotel Berlin a nice hotel, good value for money, but closer to four stars than five. I might stay there again, but it is definitely not on my list over hotels I really would like to visit again.
