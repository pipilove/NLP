Careful what you book.

Be careful of the room type if you are more than one person. Husband and I were put in a room with two double beds(no kings available) and the beds took up most of the room. Two lounge chairs were struck in the corner where you couldn't really even see the TV. Since we were going to be spending six nights, we moved to another hotel with much bigger rooms,Inn at Harbor Steps, which I highly recommend.Location was very central and great for shopping and the linens and bed were very comfortable. Staff very nice, but couldn't change the room.
