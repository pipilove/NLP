So-so

Parking here is overpriced, considering a fairly lengthy wait to collect the car from the valet service.Hotel Internet access is incredibly slow. Rooms are reasonable, although last stay I had a staff service corridor behind one wall, with staff banging trolleys into the wall repeatedly (enough to jolt the bed).Bell-staff are downright rude. I got asked to make sure I left the handle to the suitcase up in future (because it's so much effort for them to do, obviously). I couldn't find my luggage receipt and was in a hurry; they said There are too many bags to look and didn't intend to let me have my luggage back. I pressed the issue and they let me point to my luggage in their storage room. Not sure if they expected me to just give up and let them keep my belongings or not, but they sure gave that attitude. -10 out of 10 there.My second stay here, and the Hertz counter still never, ever had anyone working there. (Avoid booking anything to pickup/drop off at that hotel from hertz, but that's another story).
