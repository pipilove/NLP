Very nice

Stayed only one night. The staff were happy to accommodate our last-minute request for hypo-allergenic bedding. Breakfast was a great way to start the day on the 7th floor - it was a shame we were in a hurry to catch a flight back to NYC and we did not get to relax and enjoy it as much as we would have liked. The hotel is not super fancy or upscale, but it is clean and the value for money was definitely there. We got a great deal from www.tablethotels.com and would definitely stay here again.
