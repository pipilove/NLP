Transfered last minute!

After reading all the reviews on trip advisor, I decided to book a room for 1 night at the Royal Magda, it was highly recommended! No one could fault it! I was really looking forward to spend my husbands 40th in the romantic city until we arrived at the hotel.We were told by the man at reception there had been a problem with the guests not vacating our room in time due to a family member falling ill and being treated at the hospital. We offered to return later on in the afternnoon but was told it still might not be available. At that point my heart just sank! You can imagine how my husband was feeling.They had already arranged to put us in another hotel nearby, the Hotel Mac Mahon. I don't think they realise why we booked the room with them! If I wanted to book a hotel rated 300 plus, I would have in the first place! They offered free breakfast as compensation, which we didn't have.The Hotel Mac Mahon is also a 3 star rated but I think it is more of a 2 star hotel. Different to what was on offer at the Magda.It completely ruined our stay in Paris, as for my husband, an unforgetable 40th birthday surprise.Overall, I don't think the Royal Magda coped with the situation very well. For the trouble caused, I would expect to be transfered to a 4 star hotel. At least it would have calmed us down asap.
