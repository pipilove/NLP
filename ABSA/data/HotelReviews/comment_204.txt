Loved the location and the staff attitude

Simply the best hotel I've ever stayed in. Comfortable rooms, fantastic location, very close to the city centre and reasonably priced compared to its very central location. Above all, what we enjoyed most was the staff attitude, everyone is cheerful, helpful and very enthusiastic, they do make you feel at home. I visited Amsterdam twice and I keep going to the same hotel, it is part of my wonderful experience of this city. I have recommended Hotel Nadia to all friends and family who visited Amsterdam.
