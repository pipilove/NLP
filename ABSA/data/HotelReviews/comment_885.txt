Very nice hotel, worth the money

I was on a business trip, spent here one night. It is great modern hotel, I was very much impressed by the room, spacious, clean and modern and good size bathroom, too. Bed is huge, very comfy, nice bedlinen, you will have a good night-sleep here.Staff is great, speak good english, help you with any question.I've tried the hotel-restaurant as well, great menu, good-size portions and good wine-list!I would recommend this hotel, and next time back in Berlin I will stay here again.
