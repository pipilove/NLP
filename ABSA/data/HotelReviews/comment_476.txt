Don't stay here if you are British!!!!

Although the bathrooms are nice, the rooms are very average and the staff here are overtly anti-British. They made it abundantly clear (by way of deferential service and snide remarks/glances) that they preferred Spaniards over British clients. If you are not Spanish, then don't even think about staying here (unless you enjoy feeling like an unwelcome guest).
