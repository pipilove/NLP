Fantastic hotel

Royal Magda was fantastic! The staff were incredibly friendly and the breakfast kept us going all day. We spent two nights there and found the location was perfect for either walking or the metro is just around the corner. And because it's down a side road the rooms are also very quiet. The very nice staff gave us a great restaurant recommendation for my birthday dinner and even provided us with knives and plates when we bought cheese and bread from the market back to our room. The room was small but very clean and nicely furnished and we really didn't need it to be any bigger after all you're only there to sleep! Will return for sure and would recommend for others without hesitation.
