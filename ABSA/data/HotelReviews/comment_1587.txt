Sheraton okay

The room was large, nothing special about the bathroom, the location was great! Lots of shopping around, places to eat, and close to Pike's Market. The view from the room wasn't great. The maid insisted on cleaning our room while we were still in it. The hotel was very empty and we found out there were only 2 rooms occupied on our floor so it was very quiet! Parking was quite expensive.
