Very disappointed in almost every way

I stayed at the Seattle W for a week in June for a professional conference. I had previously stayed at the W in New Orleans and loved every second of it so I was expecting great things from the W Seattle. I couldn't have been more disappointed. They think darkness equates to ambiance. Wrong. There was no loud music on the elevators. At a W, the elevators are supposed to me like mini-clubs. You meet and party with people on the New Orleans W elevators. The worst thing was the smell when the air conditioning went on. It could best be described at cat little box or pure cat urine. Hotel management did not respond to numerous complaints saying that was the normal lavender musk smell of the W. Right... I just made sure the air never came on when I was in the room. Luckily, Seattle is a great city with lots to do.I did get an email apology from corporate after logging a complaint with Starwood during my stay. Since then, I've only recieved marketing spam from the Seattle W. I'll never stay at the Seattle W again and won't recommend it to anyone.
