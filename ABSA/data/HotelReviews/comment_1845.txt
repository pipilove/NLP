Good Hotel, Better Rooms and Poor Elevators

This was an above average Marriott Hotel overall. The lobby was a little cold and impersonal but the rooms were very nice. Very comfortable bed and FANTASTIC bathtubs with just the right pitch for a long, hot bath. The workout room/spa was very 80s and could really use an upgrade. The main piano bar was a bit cheesy as well and had a small fruit fly infestation. However, the live music played there was top notch. Room service was very inexpensive, but the food was not great, nor all that bad. The main complaints of the hotel were the 1) EXTREMELY slow elevators. They are going thru an upgrade of the elevators at this time, but waits can be as long as 25 minutes and at one point a traveller in our group took the stairs from the 32nd floor no less! 2) Breakfast on the exec floor was somewhat redundant by day 3 and I was there for 8 days and 3) The high speed internet access was $19.95 per day! Highway robbery, especially at the high rates being charged per night. Great location. Better than most Marriotts. Not high end, but better than normal.
