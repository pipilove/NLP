Fantastic deal, central, modern hotel!

Booked this hotel through hotel reservation service (hrs.de) and got a very good deal. The hotel is an old building but has been renovated so that the rooms are very modern and smart. There are good views across the city, and it is a very good location. I preferred being based at the centre of Alexanderplatz because it is so close to the older areas of Berlin. Easy walking distance to the Unter den Linden area with it's museums, cathedral and of course the Brandenburg gate and Reichstag. It is also not far to Hackescher Markt and the Tiergarten. From the Berlin hauptbahnhof either take the city S-bahn trains to alexanderplatz, or walk along the river to Alexanderplatz.The hotel was very neat and clean, relatively busy and the rooms were well looked after. There wasn't too much noise from the city, and the room was spacious and smart. Definitely recommended for people who prefer to stay in larger hotels or chains and want a predictable base for their visit to Germany's capital.
