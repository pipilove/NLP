Not a 5 Star Hotel

I stayed in this hotel on a recent business trip. The location was great only a short walk from the Central Station and easy access to Amsterdam attractions. However this is not a 5 star hotel, in reality it is a very tired 4 star hotel. My room was small and in dire need of updating. I was on the 5th floor, which was accessed via one lift that seemed to be hidden away in the back part of the hotel. Despite the higher floor I was still left a note from the hotel management with ear plugs to block out the noise from Dam Square, when I actually needed them to block out the very loud and very awful music that was piped throughout the hotel corridors. Looking out my window I had a perfect view into some apartments opposite, which meant I had to keep my blinds closed at all times for privacy. The bathroom had seen better days and the hairdryer was in shreds and unusable. However when I called the front desk I was brought one within five minutes.Overall the staff are very friendly and helpful but the rooms are in need of updating. The hotel needs to downgrade its star rating or else they will have many dissapointed guests.
