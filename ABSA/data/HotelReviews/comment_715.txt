Disappointed

We picked the hotel because we read it was convenient to everything and the reviews were good But Berlin is a sprawling city so this location was not as convenient as we had hope--Alexanderplatz is just too far from most tourist attractions. We would recommend being near the Sony Building and Potsdammer Plotz. Also, while our room was quiet and comfortable, everything was shoehorned in with the result that the shower was separated from the bed by a curtain and the toilet area was what I would described as a stall in terms of soundproofing. If you were by yourself it would be fine but otherwise....Also we asked for a tourist street map but the person we asked charged us 2 1/2 Euros.
