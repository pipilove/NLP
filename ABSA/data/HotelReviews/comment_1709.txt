Nice decor but not worth the price

Hotel Max has a great location, nice decor and good service but the price isn't justified. The bedroom is tiny (and I live in a 550 sq. ft apartment) and so is the bathroom; don't expect to take a shower without touching the shower curtain. Walls are paper thin but that's to be expected in an old building.Again, the hotel is decorated beautifully but our room didn't meet our expectations.
