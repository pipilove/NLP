Great location, but small rooms, even the suites

Beautiful hotel at excellent location near the louvre and Tuillerien (metro, exit Tuillerien) We stayed in suite 603 with our daughter of 13. She slept on the couch. Rooms are beautiful decorated, clean and well equiped. Room 603 has two tiny tiny bathrooms, 2 washbins, a toilet, small bath, shower. There was not enough pressure on the shower... The airco was working very well, freezing cold! The suite has two sony flatscreens with a sony stick port, handy! Breakfast is not cheap (29 euros pp!!) but very very good. There is also a nice small swimmingpool and a well equipped gym and sauna/steamingroom. Staff was very helpfull and polite.
