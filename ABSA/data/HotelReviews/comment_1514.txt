Met Our Expectations

Centrally located hotel is a few blocks from the water and from popular nightlife and shopping options in Belltown and downtown. I would classify this property as a three star location. We paid a wedding rate so I am not sure how it fares from a value proposition. The room was spacious although a little outdated. Perhaps some rooms have decent views but we were on a lower floor with a drab panaroma of the parking lot and some other buildings. There is an adequate fitness center, sauna and pool in the basement and a quaint bar/restaurant attached to the hotel. Parking at $30 per day is an outrage but possibly standard for downtown (you can find street parking on the weekend to save a few dollars). I would be willing to stay here again the future if the price was significantly lower than the nearby four-star competition.
