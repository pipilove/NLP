Good but not the level of luxury expected

Stayed there on New Year's Eve in a reward room so it was free. Room is on the small side (smaller than most Sheraton standard rooms), but bed was very comfortable and bathroom luxurious. Hotel was built from combining many canal houses thus it felt like a maze navigating the property, but nonetheless fun. Room service is nice but not great. Room was in the middle of the houses so the window opened to nothing but view of the corridor outside. Rooms facing the canal may get much better view. Located close to tram stop and walking distance to Anne Frank Museum. 10 minutes tram ride from Amsterdam Centraal train terminal. 45 mins from airport by train.Would probably not stay here if were to pay for the room. (advertised rate was 380 USD)
