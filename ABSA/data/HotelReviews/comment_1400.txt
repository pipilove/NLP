Roll the dice

Sold to the highest bidder is the way this place works. we made reservations months in advance for the first week of december, only to be called a couple of days before our trip and told they accidentally gave our reservation away. in talking to the manager i was told that it was given away by a travel website by accident, so I asked her why she could not call the people who booked later and cancel them and she said she had no contact info on them!!! are you kidding me?. Anyway we were supposed to have the family suite for about $180.00 a night and she said that she could give us a room at their sister property Broadway manor for $140.00 a night. As i was talking to her I looked on their website and saw I could get a room for 3 of those nights for $59.00 a night , 1 night for $99 which she later gave me the discount, but if I had not asked we would have been paying a couple extra hundered for our stay.Instead of staying in a family suite that we booked months in advance in a hotel that we picked because of tripadvisor, we were packed in a standard room of a lower rated hotel. We would have stayed elsewhere but it was a high volume week and we could not get anything reasonable on such short notice.(I'm sure they got a lot more money for the suite). Being pretty mad about this I started checking other reviews and I realized that if you change the tripadvisor search to lowest rated instead of newest, every person who gave this hotel a 1, did so because they were duped out of their reservation. The funny thing is this is the only hotel I have seen with a 48 hour cancellation policy instead of 24.I can only rate this hotel a 1 even though I'm sure it's alright once you actually get a room, but as Seinfield once said  taking the reservation is easy, it's actually about holding the reservation. Roll the dice if you want, just have a backup plan. Would love to hear a response from management!
