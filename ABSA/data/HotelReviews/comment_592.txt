Excellent Hotel in the heart of the city.

This hotel could easily be 5 star, the facilities are fantastic, the rooms beautifully furnished and equipped with all the latest technology. The bed was the most comfortable we had ever slept in. Take the continental breakfast in your room, it was really good value for money and there was a good choice. We used the spa and indoor pool in the evenings which again was excellent.The lounge and bar areas were relaxing and comfortable, and perfect for a night-cap in the evening.Our only let down was the restaurant, onour first night we had dinner and the food was very poor and the dining room was cold and did not have the same atmosphere as the rest of this beautiful hotel.Over all we would highly reccomend Hotel1898 and would deffinately make a return visit.
