Very pleased

It is a little removed from downtown but a great little place with clean rooms, a subway at the end of the street, sights within walking distance and a nice comfortable bed. You need to go up Rue des Martyrs and look for a small pastry store on the right with an entrance diagonal to the street. The best mini-quiches (hockey puck size) you will ever eat. My wife and I actually took them with us each day for lunch and snacks. I think we had 10 each in 3 days. Look for the tomatoe and anchovie one.I would stay here again as I have no complaints at all.
