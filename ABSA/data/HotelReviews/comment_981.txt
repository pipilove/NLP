A great experience for insomniacs!

This hotel always seems to get great reviews. It is both value for money and benefits from wonderfully helpful staff. It is off a main road, so slightly protected from Parisienne traffic noises although it is close to a popular church which gives you no peace whatsoever with loud bell ringing sessions.The rooms are pretty small but refurbished and whilst the bedrooms are pretty middle of the road, the bathrooms have been given a pleasant modern twist.However, beware being allocated a room at the rear of the hotel. These look out on the blank wall of an internal well shaft, so absolutely no views and the rooms are dark as a result. Noise tends to travel up the well. You are shielded from the city noises of the front facing rooms though. All rooms have a problem of paper-thin walls, so if you don't mind hearing your neighbours ' baby crying all night or early morning drinking sessions as friends catch up on their days out - this is for you.It is a great area for food - brilliant boulangeries/cheese shops, restaurants and cafes and it is literally 5 minutes from Notre Dame and the Panthenon.All in all a good experience if you are not looking for pampering or a night's sleep!
