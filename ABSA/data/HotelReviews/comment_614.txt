Great stay at the Westin Grand

Just returned from a Great 3 night stay at the Westin on a fantastic priceline deal. I would agree with earlier reviews that this hotel doesn't quite make the 5 star status it claims but is a very good 4 star property. The hotel is located in the former East Berlin and is well placed for most of the sights. Getting around is easy thanks to the U-Bahn station practically on the doorstep. The public areas are very grand especially the lobby with its huge atrium, sweeping staircase and piano player. Couldn't notice any strange smells in the lifts as mentioned by a previous poster. Bedroom was standard size and decorated in classic style. The room did show some signs of wear (nothing major though) but a refurbishment programme is in progress (we had a note apologising for any noise heard though we did not hear any). The beds were as promised Heavenly with a pillow that could be moulded to suit any height preference. The bathroom whilst adequate was a rather basic white tiled room which didn't quite match the granduer of the bedroom and public areas. Everything worked well though and there was a good selection of bathroom products. Staff were at all times exceptionally courteous and polite. Breakfast was not included and at €13 overpriced as was the bottle of water strategically placed in the room at €4.50. All in all I have no real complaints about the hotel and would have no problems in recommending it. If you are lucky enough to be awarded the hotel through priceline it really is a fantastic bargain.
