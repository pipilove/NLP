Major Dissapointment

This place has gone DOWNHILL. I had stayed here before about 5 years ago and thought I it would be nice to be back. NO! They have done the rooms in a more funky modern decoration rather than the luxury classic style they had before. Interestingly, this hotel USED to be a 'luxury collection' level sheraton and they have lost that status!!!! So only in the past couple years have they lost that status and that is a bad sign. Location is good, but there are so many other better hotels right nearby that are much, much better. Don't settle for this one... I'm not going back.
