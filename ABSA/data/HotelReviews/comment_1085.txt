Room double booked! Rigid

 On arrival at the Duquesne Eiffel Hotel I was welcomed with information that my room booked double booked. The Duquesne Eiffel had arranged another hotel in the area to take us, the Hotel Splendid, which was OK but not my hotel of choice.The option of staying one night, at the Splendid, and the remainder back at the Duquesne Eiffel or staying at the splendid for the entire stay was offered.I suggested that as compensation for the error made by the Duquesne Eiffel that they pay for the night at the Splendid and that I would then stay for the reaminder of the time with them; A fair and reasonable request (where the Splendid, the Duquesne Eiffel and myself benefit equally) I thought!This suggestion was meet by a unyieldng and, in my oppinion, some what incomprehensible no! Why the Duquesne Eiffel would rather pass my entire custom to the Splendid, a competitor, rather than reimburse me for my inconvenience astounded me.I therefore did not stay at the Duquesne Eiffel! Prefering to stay with the Splendid who were very welcoming.The only compensation offered was free breakfast which, if the Splendid is anything to go by, would be the bare essentials continetal for 11 euros; not what I would call value for money!
