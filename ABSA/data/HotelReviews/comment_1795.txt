Great value for a downtown hotel

My sisters and I decided to go to Seattle for a shopping weekend and the Mediterranean was $100 US less expensive than chain hotels right downtown. I had problems with the hotel website and booked directly and got a price lower than the web price. The room was basic, but clean and nicely laid out, with the added advantage of the kitchen area for snacks. The hallways and public areas were spotless. We had the corner room fronting two streets, so were worried about noise, but the area is quiet after 11, so that wasn't a problem. The front desk staff were all helpful.From the hotel to the Pike Place Market area is a pleasant 45 minute walk or $7 cab ride, and there are good bistro-type restaurants in the neighbourhood. Note regarding parking. The hotel has a well-secured (hotel room key access) parkade under the building. When you check in, park in the loading zone in front of the hotel and the clerk will give you instructions on how to access the parkade. We spent time trying to figure it out beforehand.
