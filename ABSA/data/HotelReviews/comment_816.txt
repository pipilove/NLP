Pick of the best

So I went online and booked this hotel through lastminute.com, which also meant the booking included breakfast. It was also surprisingly cheap considering this is a four star hotel. Anyway, the low-down is, quite simply, this is one of the best hotels you can stay in in Berlin for this kind of price. The staff are very well-mannered and unfailingly helpful; the room I was given was clean, comfortable, and pleasant. There's a very nice restaurant downstairs with a glassed-in atrium and you'll notice that many people visit it from outside who are not guests (a very good sign). Coming from the UK, I was very aware that prices at the restaurant and at the hotel were lower than I would expect. This hotel is definitely value for money. I'd say the only slight drawback is that it's about 10 minutes' walk from Potsdamer Platz. That's not great if, during your stay, it's snowing or raining heavily, as it was on both the days I stayed here. But taxis are plentiful and comparatively inexpensive.I'm quite a choosy person when it comes to hotels. But given the price I would recommend this one unreservedly.
