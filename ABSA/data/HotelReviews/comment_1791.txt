Good Bargin

We stayed at the Mediterranean Inn at for a couple of nights at the end of vacation around the Olympic Peninsula. The price is a good bargin compared to other hotels in the city center. The location is not bad and easy to get downtown, which is not far from hotel. We used public transportation. The views of the city and water are great, especially from the roof patio they have at the Inn. The staff was very helpful and pleasant. They also have an excellant laundry room for guest to use. We would recommend this Inn. Note try to get rooms off the street side facing water.
