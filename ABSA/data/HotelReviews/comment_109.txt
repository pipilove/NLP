Not a happy customer

The executive room we booked was simply like stepping into a MFI show room. poorly put together, bits coming off, bed board was well worn. Noisy next to the room. We duly complained and were upgraded to a suite. The suite was a little bigger, but I would have not been happy to have paid full price for the room. Glasses/tea cups were not cleaned out on a daily basis. When we complained the head housekeeper said that some guests prefer us not to clear. Ordered something of the night menu and only one item of two arrived. In summary, go there, complain, get upgraded,complain,get a few quid knocked off the bill and you will be a happy guest with value for money..
