Hardly a five star

Whereas it was clean, modern, there wasnt really much in the way of friendliness or service. The lobby was lovely, and the location was perfect for access to city and country excursions. Good restaurants and bars all around too. The Winter Garden restaurant was fantastic and you should visit it even if you dont stay in the hotel. We would probably stay there again if in Amsterdam but only because we heard that lesser star ratings can be awful in that city.We really enjoyed our time in Holland but we were disappointed with the litter in the city. The fries in a cone were gorgeous. A local 'delicacy'.
