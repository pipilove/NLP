Nice hotel close to Circular Quay and Pitt Street Mall

The hotel is clean and quite new. The room is nice and spacious. Noise from street noise is minimum even though it is heart of the business district (I stayed in the sixth floor). Breakfast buffer in the hotel restaurant is above average. There are plenty of cafes near by that you can sit outside weekdays do people watching. On the downside, the bed is harder than I expect for a upscale hotel. The lobby is small. It can be crowded when a lot of people are checking out at the same time in the morning.
