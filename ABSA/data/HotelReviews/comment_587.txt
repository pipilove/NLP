What a find!

We returned from Barcelona last weekend - it was our first visit and a special occasion, celebrating my husbands birthday. It was a surprise booking for him and the hotel was discreet in all correspondence since my booking earlier this year. I booked a superior room and it exceeded all expectations. We had views around the city, our bedroom opposite the Cathedral. The hotel is situated on La Ramblas, but you would never know as our room on the 6th floor was well sound proofed and tucked back with views of the luxurious suite privatepool terrace below. It was an oasis amidst an exciting and lively city. The hotel was exceptionally clean, the facilities including the roof terrace and spa were superb, the room finished to a high standard and the service was very friendly at all times and nothing seemed to be too much. We will certainly return as we managed to have a long weekend with a good mix of rest, sun  evening relation on the roof terrace, cool drinks by the pool, sight seeing and excellent food  wine. The only point we would make is book your own taxi to the airport from outside the hotel, the taxi company charged us nearly double the fare when we booked through the hotel to return to the airport.
