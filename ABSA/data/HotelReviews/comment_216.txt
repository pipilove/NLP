Less than what I expected

The Hotel Nadia was okay. Just okay. The room was the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed at in my life! I couldn't dream of unpacking a thing. Not a thing. And the breakfast was very basic; bread, cheese, croissant, coffee...that's it. I have stayed in Amsterdam before and have paid less for more...much more. The staff however was very nice and very helpful. I do feel though that they were obsessed with what their rating from me would be. It's amazing what the Travel Site ratings impact is on hotels now. I think they get terrified of getting a negative review. Sometimes I wonder how much these reviews are 'rigged'. So, I will give them a neutral.
