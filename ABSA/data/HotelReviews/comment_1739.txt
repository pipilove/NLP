Absolute Best!!

There is a reason there are so many great reviews for this hotel - they are the best. The views are great and the service is superior!!! Our team stayed here last year as well and the experience just gets better. The beds  linens are so comfy - all of us slept like babies! The rooms are well appointed and very clean! And bonus points for being so close to some great shopping and restaurants. When you are here, check out Vons for a super martini!!! We will be coming here again!
