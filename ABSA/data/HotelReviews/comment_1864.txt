A+ to the Marriott Sydney Harbour

We have stayed in many hotels and this hotel was by far one of our favorites of all time. The views were stunning, the service was perfect, the rooms were clean and we thought this hotel was wonderful. We are coming back to Sydney this summer and we wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else. We give it an A+ and we are hard to please.
