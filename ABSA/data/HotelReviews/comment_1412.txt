Great base in SF

Great place to use as a base to explore some of San Francisco - far better than the overpriced and tatty Fisherman's Wharf Marriott I stayed in last year. Friendly staff, clean rooms with plenty of space and easy walking distance from Fisherman's Wharf and Chinatown. I didn't find the parking a problem - it may depend on the size of your car! No surprise that it's on a fairly decent hill but that's half the fun of San Francisco! I'll definitely be back again and the Nob Hill Motor Inn is my new recommendation for anyone asking about places to stay in San Francisco.
