nice accomodations but not nice policies

Grand Marina was a nice hotel, very modern and European in design and good location. The location was on the water, a short walk from La Rambla. Very quiet. However, had a problem on checkin. I had booked a room with 2 twin beds for myself and 2 children. On checkin they insisted that I upgrade to a more expensive room and pay extra for another bed even after I insisted that we didn't need 3 beds. They said it was their 'politics' and I didnt have any choice. This cost me an additional 100 Euros per night! Then the concierge was very demeaning and condescending to my children, kept saying they would hate everything there was to do, I must spend 12 days in Barcelona, why would I want to go to Montseratt??? How absurd and then made sure to point out all the Mcdonalds on the map for the entire time, even after I told him I would not be going to McDonalds. On top of that, he told me I would be mugged or pickpocketed if I took a purse with my anywhere in the city. Needless to say, my children were very put off with Spain within the first hour. I must say that the trip was fine after that despite the first few hours.Other than that, I liked the location and the rooms were very modern and clean.
