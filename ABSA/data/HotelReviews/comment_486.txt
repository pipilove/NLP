Great hotel! Would go back.

Our group of 4 (two teenagers plus my niece and myself) rented 2 rooms on the 15th floor of this great hotel on December 28. Super-sized non-smoking rooms, wonderful bathroom, great sheets, towels, bathrobes and slippers. We had a view of the Tibidabo from our rooms.The 10 euro breakfast on the top floor with fantastic views of Barcelona was well worth the money. The rooms were 100 euros/night (plus taxes and extras) which I thought was reasonable.Helpful and polite staff. Offered maps and directions to my favorite tapas places (Cafeteria Cataluå¸½a and Ciudad Condal )No noise at night except for the odd ambulance or police car.  I was hesitant to book so far from the Ramblas/Gotico area, but then decided that if what I could afford was out of the Ramblas area, then it might as well be well-communicated via train or metro, hence the choice near the Sants station.We liked it so much that we went back to the hotel for their 13 euro, three course menu del dia in the lounge on the ground floor before leaving town.Great for travelers arriving by train, just a short walk across the plaza, but also good for those arriving by car from southern points as you just have to turn right off of Diagonal onto Numancia and go down a few blocks. No getting trapped in busy Barcelona traffic. The parking lot is under the hotel and there is a hefty daily fee, but that is normal in all hotels I called in Barcelona.This is a large, contemporary hotel, so if you are looking for quaint, typically Spanish style, you might try elsewhere. It was perfect for us!
