I love de L'Abbaye- charming, warm, and great location

I've been to Paris many times, and had had this hotel recommended to me more than once- didn't book it until a trip with a girlfriend to hang out in cafes, shop, and wear red lipstick. The rooms are small, true, but for the price in Paris perfectly fine. Nice marble-y bathrooms with everything you need.The public rooms are the real show here- no less because we arrived in a very rainy week. There is a lovely living room with a fireplace - bit of a contest to see who can snag the comfy armchairs closest to the fire and read all day- and a solarium where you take breakfast. There is also a small bar, which of course is almost empty and only really hotel guests, so, unlike many Paris hotels, you can spend quite a lot of time in your hotel but still have a drink or just be out of your room.The location is killer- smack in the middle of the 6th near all the best shopping and great cafes.
