Not my option of 5 Stars

Had the pleasure of visiting Berlin for a city break in September.1st impression were great of the hotel, we were really looking forward to staying in a 5 star hotel. Immediately we were meet by the Hotels bell man at the taxi door and he took our luggage. Swift check in, so far so good.We had looked to pay for an upgraded to the executive floor but they were fully booked. In the Bedroom this is were the hotel did not meet my expectations the bedroom we got was definitely not 5 stars, no tea or coffee making facilities in the room, no bath robes or slippers, and for the bathroom, well I've seen bigger bathrooms on airplanes I can stress this enough and it was stiflingly hot all the time. In there guest information stated that rooms had access to the internet but seemly our room did not have. I had booked a double room but got two single beds, with a folded duvet resting at the bottom of the bed; it had the look of a Young Hostel.I do have to mention the staffs were excellent in all departments of the hotel, Very helpful.I would not recommend the restaurant either the food in not good quality and service was very slow and offer priced.I do usually stay in 4 star hotel and have stayed in better 4 stars than the  5 star Steigenberger Berlin.
