Horrible cancellation policy - beware!

My husband and I were supposed to stay at this hotel at the end of August for our wedding anniversary. I got a good rate through their summer promotion and booked directly through their website. If you do that, please be careful and read the small print! Once you book it, it's impossible to cancel or change the date. I made the reservation 5 months in advance, then I found out that I was pregnant and couldn't go to Paris anymore. I contacted the hotel in hopes that they will consider my special situation and refund my money since I was giving them 4 months advance notice! No such luck. I was told that it was impossible refund my money and due to some account reason they couldn't even move my reservation to another date. That is too bad - I was really excited about staying at this hotel and would have definitely come back to them next summer. Now I will be looking somewhere else with more understanding management and flexible cancellation and date change policies.
