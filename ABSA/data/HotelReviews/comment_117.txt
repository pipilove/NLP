Great location with nice breakfast in a good basic hotel

I read the reviews of this hotel after I had booked it in a package. I was wary of what awaited me. It was a great basic hotel. It could not have been in a better location. It is near a major transportation stop. It faces a canal. It is even across from the Hard Rock Cafe. People like to criticize the Hard Rock but for families, it is a place with a predictable menu and drinks that can be refilled. The Rijks Museum and the Van Gogh Museum are a short walk away. Behind the Park is the elite shopping street for Amsterdam. A short walk to the front gets you to the Leidse Square and a good location for drifting through some of the best and most convenient shopping I have experienced in Europe. It might not be the Ritz but when we travel to Europe we look for clean, convenient, near transportation, and a breakfast other than just stale bread. The Park fits our bill. I would definitely use it again.
