Wonderful Start

After spending around 20 straight hours on airplanes and in airports, my wife and I arrived at the Montecarlo at 11PM, for the start of a long awaited and eagerly anticipated Spain vacation. I was thinking nap time, but as anyone who has been to Barcelona knows, the city is just waking up about then. So we threw some cold water on our faces and out into the night we went. Barcelona is an exciting and fun city. The Hotel Montecarlo is perfectly situated on Ramblas, a short walk to many fine restaurants and cafes, along with open air markets and museums. For longer jaunts, we took public transportation. Being an urban planner, I truly appreciated Barcelona's splendid combination of art, design, form and function. At no time did I ever feel lost or unsafe (using some common sense, of course). The Hotel Montecarlo was the perfect compliment to our Barcelona experience. The room, overlooking the Ramblas was spacious and modern with a classy shower/jacuzzi tub. The staff was very accommodating and helpful. In particular, we left our passports in our room's safe when we left for Girona. Marina, the front desk staff person, was very helpful and made sure that we received them without incident a few days later. Marina also was extremely helpful regarding local sites, customs and eateries. It was the perfect start to a wonderful vacation. Without a doubt, we would return to the Hotel Montecarlo.
