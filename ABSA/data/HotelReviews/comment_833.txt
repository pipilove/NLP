Cheap

We booked a twin bed room in this hotel through an internet travel agency about three months before our stay.The hotel can be easily located from U-Bahn stop of Samariterstasse which is in about 5 minutes walking distance.The room was unfortunately a big disappointment as there were two beds in the room but not even side by side. Since we are a young couple and this was meant to be an anniversary trip, it can be easily understood that the room was inconvenient. Anyway, we didn't complain to the reception as we worked it out by ourselves.The receptionists were friendly and helpfull when they could understand us since their english was quite poor.The truth is that compared to its cost it was good and clean.Everyday we had our towels changed but not our sheets, and the bathroom was really big in relation to the room.Breakfast was as described hot bouffet and was more than adequate.The period we stayed the hotel was full and almost all residents were germans which made us feel good in the sense that locals chose this hotel for their Berlin weekend and they know better....LA PALMA was really nice and I also recommend it!!!(You can find its delivery menu with all address details in a stand across the reception desk).Overall, we loved Berlin and we will try to visit again. Next time we will make the reservation directly with the hotel!!!!
