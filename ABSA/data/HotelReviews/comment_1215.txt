Nice Place, but Loud Pipes

Had a nice time at Hotel Rex -- mainly location was perfect. However, the pipes or plumbing was so loud that there was a constant thumping going on whenever anyone used the sink above us.Room was clean and the place was nice. But I enjoyed some of the other Joie De VIvre hotels in the same two block area more.
