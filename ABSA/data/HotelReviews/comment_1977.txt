Faultless and great value

This hotel was simply faultless for the price. I have travelled extensively and I found this property comparative to any in the world. We travelled to Sydney for my brother's wedding and had a number of rooms on a range of floors and all were of a high standard - the showers are incredible. We also had a range of needs in terms of room types that changed on very short notice and the staff were very accommodating even though the hotel was full. Further, my mother is disabled and the staff could not have been more helpful and understanding of her needs. I recommend making the most of the facilities - the steam room is lovely. The location is great and we even tried the bistro for dinner one night and the meal was great. That said we also used the cafes around the hotel as there are plenty of options.This hotel is great and we will be heading back as soon as possible!
