What a welcome!

Have just returned from a short break in Amsterdam, staying in the Nadia Hotel. We have rarely encountered such friendly welcoming staff who really made our visit memorable. Five minutes after we checked in Flowers were delivered to our room with a welcome card - really nice touch.You might not get the same high class amenities that are offered in some of the bigger chains, but if you want to stay somewhere that makes you feel at home from the moment that you walk in the door, then this is the place for you. Personal service and a warm welcoming smile, coupled with unique rooms devoid of any uniformity make this a place to remember - I'd have no hesitation recommending it to anyone...
