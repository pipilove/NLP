Best North Seattle Hotel

What a cool hotel. Definitely the place to stay in north Seattle. Love the shuttles to downtown, the U village shopping center and Adobe. Now my favorite place to stay when I am not required to be in the downtown area.Love all the extra touches like the alacarts.The free wine tasting, cookies and breakast were awesome.The lite meal was perfect on one of the coldest nights in Seattle in a long time. We did not want to out for dinner too cold. The warm hospitality made the difference.I also liked the added security touches of the keyed elevator.Will definitely stay there again! Great Value!
