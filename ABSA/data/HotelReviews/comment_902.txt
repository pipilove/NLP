Sorry - disappointed

The splurge of our 2-week European trip was 4 nights at the Georges V in Paris in September 2006. Certainly it is beautiful, the service was impressive, but unless there is a view, you could be in any city, which I found very disappointing. For a thousand dollars a night, (not a discounted rate) the hotel could not find a room to switch us to with a view. Our room was the only room down a long hallway (#310, I believe) that looked out onto an alley-like street with neon signs right in our view. I didn't want to show my extreme disappointment to my husband but I would not go again unless a view was specifically mentioned as reserved. I was hoping for a view similar to their advertising. Perhaps $1,000 rooms are entry-level at this hotel.
