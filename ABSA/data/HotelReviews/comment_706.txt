A Hard Review To Write

Stayed for 3 nights and have mixed feelings about this hotel.I booked a single room - big mistake. It was no bigger than a matchbox and didn't even have a wardrobe, just a small rail that pulled out from the end of the bed, which was set against a wall. The bed was quite high and the draws for clothes were below the mattress. So no closet, no chest of draws and a room the size of a phonebox. I complained but was told nothing doing, hotel was full and I got what I'd paid for, a single room.Breakfast was adequate, but the worst I've had in all my trips to Berlin. It had all the usual, egg, bacon, cheeses etc but no smoked salmon and was not great for a 4 star hotel. It done its job but didn't make you want to refill your plate a second time.It wasn't all bad though. The actual hotel is very nice and has a quite expensive feel about it and as mentioned by others the location is superb. I always try to stay near the Kudamm, and this is on a quite street just behind the KaDeWe. I couldn't have wished for a better spot. A supermarket and some very nice restaurants a 2 min walk away with Zoo station a 10 min stroll.The staff were very friendly and helpful apart form one (there's always one!) but this was the guy I complained to so we probably got off on the wrong footing. The rest were fine and pleasant.Would I stay again? If the price was right and only in a double room. I would trade the breakfast off for the location which again is excellent.
