great priceline rate and large room

We live in a Seattle suburb and wanted to stay downtown for a wedding. I selected a 4 star in downtown Seattle on priceline for $99. The reservation was accurate and there were no problems at check in. We were given a king bed in the old tower. The room was large with a comfortable bed. However, under the duvet was a traditional old blanket. Who knows when it was last washed...I was surprised to see that in such a high end chain hotel. The other motel like feature were thin and rough towels. Valet parking was $35 and wired internet was $10.
