The hotel was nice enough, but I was there with my significant other and they gave us two twin beds. When we called down to get it resolved the first girl we talked to was NOT helpful and pretty much an airhead. The gentleman who helped us with our bags was MUCH better! He noticed the situation, went down and spoke to the manager on our behalf and they moved us immediately to another room. Although the room had a view of a cement wall at least it had a double bed. The location is within a 5 min walk of Darling Harbour.
