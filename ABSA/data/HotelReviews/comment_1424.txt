What a letdown! - Renaissance Parc 55 San Francisco

After reading other reviews we had expected better from this hotel. Room decors are boring, to say the least, and furnishings are much like those you would find in a highway motel. It is located next to a rough part of town. Parking was expensive at $35 per night (2003). Next time we will look for better value. This hotel just doesn't cut it!
