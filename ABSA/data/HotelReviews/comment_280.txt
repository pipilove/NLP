fine small hotel

My family of 4 (2 children aged 10 and 15) stayed at the 7 Bridges for 4 days in July. The hotel is the quintessential Amsterdam canal house- charming, authentic, perfectly located- walking distance to every major attraction. The room was clean, comfortable, spacious- no air conditioning, lovely outdoor terrace. It was the only room that could accommodate 4 people. Excellent breakfast served in our room daily. Helpful staff- stored our luggage until room was ready. This is not a modern American style hotel. but for those seeking to experience the true Amsterdam, this was a wonderful place to stay. My children thoroughly enjoyed it, and we would definitely stay there again.
