Stylish, Spacious

 Our perfect hotel is one that offers a central location to the attractions we want to see - with spacious, comfortable rooms and good service.art'otel, Mitte in Berlin definitely fulfilled these requirements.Our room (superior double) was very spacious and extremely comfortable - with a bath for relaxing those tired walking muscles. The onsite restuarant was also excellent - supported by good advice on local eating establishments when we wanted to venture out.The Hotel is less than 1/2 block from the closest U Bhan station - but is situated in a quiet street. Walking time to many sights (Unter den Linden, Gendarmenmakt, Deutches Museum, Checkpoint Charlie, Nikolaivertel etc. was less than 15 minutes - while virtually everything else was easily accessible by U-Bahn, starting almost next door.
