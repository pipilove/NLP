A good hotel let down by bad service...

We stayed at Sheraton on the Park for three nights in a city view king room on the 11th floor, the room was large and spacious, newly renovated and had a marble bathroom with a separate bath and shower.The hotel is in a great location, it's close to major shopping areas and multiple forms of public transport, and the executive lounge is fantastic. The lobby decor is nice and the bar/dining options were good.However the service wasn't that amazing, it took 25 minutes to get our car out of valet on one occasion and 15 minutes on another. The bell boy took so long to come collect our bags when we checked out we ended up just struggling with them ourselves. The staff were neither rude or nice, just average.The room was very noisy, we could hear the rooms around us and everything going on in the hallway. My parents were also staying at the hotel on a different floor and they also had the same noise problems.In the room we stayed in we had shutters instead of curtains, these didn't block out enough light in the morning and had large cracks where they joined each other, so the room wasn't very dark in the mornings. If I stayed here again I'd definitely be requesting a room with curtains.Overall my experience at this hotel was a good one, I would stay at this hotel again if I got a good rate, I was just disappointed a 5 star hotel would have poor service.
