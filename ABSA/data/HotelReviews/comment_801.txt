a little disappointing

Elegant lounge and breakfast area, but rooms standard corporate style. Carpet stained in both rooms. No evening turndown service. Twin bedded rooms have small beds with hard mattresses. Unexciting toileteries. Would agree that this is a good 4-star and not a 5-star hotel.Price dropped on Expedia, 3 days before we were due to arrive so that we were unable to cancel our Swissotel booking and re-book through Expedia.Concierge very helpful.Exterior of the hotel spoilt by huge C  A shop at ground floor level.
