Bad Room

I was pleasantly surprised that I was given a room with a king-size bed, so I was off to a good start, but that soon ended. The bed sheets were old and felt like they were poorly washed. The room had a very poor shower that trickled out water. Plus they had rigged some type of showerhead using a bath faucet. The drain was slow and you waded around in the shower water even with the poor water flow from the shower. One side of the room is all window with a patio window...not much of a view. So with the window also came all the city noise. Unfortunately, the fan settings for the room were either Off or Automatic so it did not help to drown out the city and hotel noise. It was slightly cool outside and the cold air just poured in from the bottom seal of the patio window. The hotel does have a good selection of local beers and wines. The food was okay but very over priced, as you will find throughout the downtown area. The best meal I had was at the Seattle Tap Room in the airport. Beware, if you use the Grayline for transportation, allow plenty of time, as they ran up to an hour late.
