Very nice hotel

I'm going to give the Plaza Paris Vendome 5 stars. If there were 4.5 stars I'd actually give that because of just a few hesitations below. There is a great staff (concierges Daniel and Emmanuelle were very helpful), very clean and modern redone rooms, the pool and steam room are fun and different for Paris and the location near the Louvre is great but there are a just a few points that might keep it from 5 star status.The rooms are beautiful but tight even for Europe. It doesnt' have the grand look of the 5 star hotels and it's on a tiny back street behind the Meurice (some people may like the back street for the quiet) If you're looking for (expensive) Paris 5 star then try the Meurice, Crillon or George V but we were very comfortable and well taken care of. (Do go to The Meurice for breakfast 1/2 a block away - like having breakfast at Versailles). The restaurant at the hotel is fantastic and even if we don't stay there next time we'll make a special trip for dinner to Pinxo in the hotel (have the fruit with coconut milk and mint for dessert)
