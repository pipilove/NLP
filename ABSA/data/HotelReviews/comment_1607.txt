Poor Service

All the good reviews the Andra gets makes me wonder if I stayed at the same place.My wife and I spent the last three nights of our honeymoon in Seattle at the Andra. I wish it had at least been the first three days of our trip so that we didn't have such an anti-climax.Having read a previous bad review of this hotel, I contacted the Andra in advance to reserve a room on a high floor away from the elevators as soundproofing is non-existent.What room did I get? One on a lower floor opposite the elevator. They were only willing to move us away from the elevator but on the same floor.Our package included champagne and truffles upon arrival. The truffles didn't arrive until our final night after two complaints to the front desk.I handed an item of clothing in to be laundered. It came back ruined.Overall, the Andra is a great looking hotel and would get more marks from me but for the poor service.The only saving grace was the adjacent Lola restaurant which serves up great food.
