Love the hotel, but this stay was disappointing

I travel to San Francisco two or three times a year, and one of my favorite destinations is the St. Francis. It's a wonderful location, right across the street from Union Square and just blocks from the city's Theater District.But my stay this past Memorial Day weekend was, overall, disappointing. First, the positives: the room was clean and the Heavenly Bed was as great as always! The lobby is lovely, and I love the way the hotel has leveraged its marvelous history by providing so many vintage pictures of its past glory days entertaining kings and presidents.The negatives, however, far outweighed the positives (at least on this visit):* Check-in was excruciatingly slow, even though we checked in at about 11 pm, with only one person in line in front of us. There were three people available to check guests in, but none was very efficient.* The coffee maker in our room was defective. When I called Service First to request a new one, the representative gave me the 5th degree on whether I'd properly operated the one in the room. We never did get a replacement, and decided to go to the Starbucks down the block instead.* There was paint peeling from the wall in the bathroom in about a 2 square foot area.* Even though I am a Starwood Gold Preferred Guest, we did not receive turndown service or a newspaper during our two nights at the St. Francis.* Our room had no hotel directory in the black portfolio provided in the room. Again, I contacted Service First to request one. It never came.I've stayed at the St. Francis five or six times in the past 5 years and--until now--have always had a very pleasant experience. I am hoping this past visit was an anomaly, not the beginning of a new trend.
