Horrible Experience!! Beware

We had read great things about this place. The rooms are large, indeed. But, if you are on the 1st floor, you will hear your neighbors walking around upstairs. Those are the good things, now on to our stay.Our experience before we got there was troubling. We called from Monterey to verify a late check-in. The front desk was rude and said that 'they liked to get some sleep around here, too!!'. We planned on checking in by 10 pm.Upon arrival, the front desk clerk (after 15 silent minutes) said that the room we had reserved (family suite) was not available! Absurd! We tried our best to find out how they had given our room away. We have a family of four and needed the suite. After an hour of tense discussions, we finally were put in a room with two beds and a roll away bed. That sufficed for one night. The clerk then made a concession on the price for the rest of our stay. We were tired and accepted his offer. It seemed reasonable.The next day, the owner called. It impressed me that he cared, until I found out that all he wanted to do was retract the agreement on price that had already been signed and charged. It goes on and on from there. At first he said he would 'honor' the agreement, then he changed his mind later in the day. Our entire stay was marred by the whole mess. More tense moments occurred upon check out. Customer service is not in their vocabulary. $$$$ is.To top if off, they intentionally charged an unauthorized amount on our credit card! This amount was considerably higher than the agreed upon rate.San Francisco has many better alternatives than this!! Hospitality missed the boat here.
