very noisy

i stayed only one night in this hotel in april 2008 at the end of our australian trip. The hotel is located nearby china town.I must say, that it was very noisy. We had a room at the back of the hotel and we heard the airconditioning machines from the buildings across the street. When you have a room to the street, you have the monorail directly in front of your window. So it is hard to find a quiet room.Overall the best years of this hotel are over.I also stood in the novotel darling harbour, it was cheaper and better.I would not choose this hotel again.
