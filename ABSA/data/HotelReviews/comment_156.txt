A Fantastic Break

We had read the reviews and some were positive and others not and I was a little concerned as I had booked this last minute but I have to say we had a great time at the Victoria. The staff were brilliant. There was a lovely lady on reception called Ina who was very helpful, Sebastian in the restaurant was very informative regarding the food. Three nights we eat in the restaurant and each meal was a delight.My only little moan was breakfast, some of hot items were not hot, there was plenty of food and I realise its difficult looking after the vast amount of guests, but you do pay 20Euros for breakfast so its not cheap. We will be returning to the Victoria as it was a lovely hotel, just opposite the station so we had no dificulty in finding the hotel. An ideal location for a tourist.
