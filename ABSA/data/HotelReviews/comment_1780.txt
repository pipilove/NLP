Good location/value for those who can walk

We were looking for a hotel near the city center that wouldn't break the bank, yet keep us close to the attractions of the downtown area. The Med fits the bill for those who don't mind a bit of a walk - though the walk itself is through nice downtown areas with plenty of shops and restaraunts. If you don't feel like making the mile or so trek back after a night on the town, a cab ride from Pike's Market area is less than $10 (and worth it if it is raining). The staff was friendly, and there is a Starbucks inside the main level. While you won't get wireless internet in the rooms, there are two terminals located in the lobby, and a business center with three more computers and printers on the main floor as well. The workout room was unimpressive, but if you are hard-core you will probably prefer to run along the waterfront anyway. All and all a good choice for younger travelers or those who don't mind a quick cab ride to save some coin on the hotel room price.
