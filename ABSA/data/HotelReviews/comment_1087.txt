Friendly and well located

Easy to find hotel near to metro stop. Staff are friendly and helpful and speak good English. Big, comfy sofas in reception/bar area with selection of newspapers. Had a room looking over local rooftops which was quiet and the bathroom had its own exterior window making a pleasant change.Tried some local cafes for breakfast but actually found the hotel one better - wider choice of food for a reasonable price. Only down side was the room was adjacent to the lift shaft and there were associated creaking noises every time the lift was in use.
