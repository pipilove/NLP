Great small hotel

 We thoroughly enjoyed our weeklong stay at Hotel Fita. Our group of four stayed in two rooms, both of which were large, clean, and airy. We especially appreciated the help of Loes de Rapper in making trip suggestions for travel outside of Amsterdam. We found the location, breakfast, and the facilities to be excellent. The extras of free laundry, internet access, and long distance phone calls were much appreciated, since we were traveling to a couple other locations and could confirm our arrangements. We would highly recommend the hotel and its hosts for any travelers, but especially those who appreciate a safe, clean, and quiet location near the museums, tram stop, and parks.
