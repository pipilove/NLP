Great location for tourists

Location was great. Hotel was pretty good too.Don't miss the complimentary wine tasting at 5pm every day - great way to meet other travellers and enjoy a glass or two.Rooms have a fridge which is handy and there are safety deposit boxes available (not in room which is a little bit of a pain).Within walking distance to everything at Fisherman's Wharf which is the tourist hub. There's a supermarket (Safeway I think) next door which is very handy!Rooms were pretty standard (we had a 2 x double one which was big enough for 2 adults and 2 kids) - but it's the location which sells this place.
