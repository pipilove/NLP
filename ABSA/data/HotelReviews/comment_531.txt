Good option in Barcelona

This is a good hotel option in Barcelona.  Property generally: Overall, while the design elements are very well carried out, this does feel primarily like a business hotel, and offers no particular Spanish, Catalanian, or even particularly European character per se. It is, however, very modern and has comfortable, clean, fashionable public spaces. Rooms: Well sized, good amenities, well kept, clean and very stylish. Good for either a holiday or a business trip. The windows are well insulated, so even overlooking the busy street, the rooms remain quiet, though hallway noise does come through the door. Location: Excellent. The property is an easy walk to Passeig de Gracia, La Ramblas, and even the beach is not a difficult hike. Oddly, there was no city map provided in the hotel, though I didn't ask the concierge who I assume would have had one available. Service: Every staff member I came into contact with was helpful and generally friendly, and were able to speak with me in English and French.The only warning to people generally about Barcelona is that the shopping is incredibly good - perhaps amongst the best shopping cities in the world - so beware the smoking credit card!
