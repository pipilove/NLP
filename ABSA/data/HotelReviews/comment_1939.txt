The hotel was fantasically placed being preety much smack bang in the middle of Sydney.The room was fantastic with everything you could wish for. Huge wardrobes, tv, mini bar, deluxe bathroom. Everything was fantastic.Just make sure that the fire alarm doesn't go off when your on the 23rd floor as it's a long way down.On a plus side, the restuarant was awesome and the food was brilliant.
