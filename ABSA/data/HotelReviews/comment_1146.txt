A very &quot;hot&quot; first nigth in Paris

I use tripadviser very frequently to consult travel places worldwide. I am a physician in Brazil and travel around the world in Medical Conferences and Meetings.The last one was in Vienna and Paris. My first night in Paris was very &quot;hot&quot; literally, because the air conditioner is broken and the temperature even at night was above 75o F. I try everything: call the front desk, go there and talk to the manager, try to fix myself the control. Finally sweat and tired I quit. I take a bath and open the window (the suggestion of the front desk manager) and try to sleep. The Morfy's Law seen to follow me that night so as the temperature drops the noises go up and I have to choose between a &quot;hot&quot; night or a &quot;noise&quot; one. The next day before breakfast I go to front desk and the day manager promises me to fix the air conditioner. When I arrive in the evening I find a portable air conditioner adapted at my window, and it works but the noise is even louder than outside. I go down again and insist to change to other room and the manager tries to elude me sawing that all rooms are at the same condition. I call for checkout and than the new room appear. I stay in this new room (not an upgrade one) for 5 nights and the air conditioner works fine and in silence. Be aware of troubles room at Elysse Regencia in Paris, and if you don't complain about the troubles you get the hotel staff will smile to you and say &quot;Merci&quot;. (First room is 24 and second 64)
