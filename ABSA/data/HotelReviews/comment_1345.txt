Nice Hotel, Great Location

Great location close and/or easily accessible to fun activities in San Franciso. Directly across the street from the cable cars with easy access to downtown and Chinatown. Within walking distance to Ghiradelli Square, Fisherman's Wharf and Pier 39. Much safer than hotels located in Union Square area. Hotel decor was beautiful, similar to being on a cruise ship, with great wine gathering each evening at 5 p.m. Rooms were small and narrow. Rooms on the interior face other rooms, with no view. Rooms on the exterior face bay, cannery or park. Cannery side is noisy during the day and evening, even on the higher levels. Fourth floor rooms do not have old wood decor like other levels. Most of the staff is very friendly, however, some have an attitude that borders on arrogance. Overall a nice hotel, but I would hesitate to pay the higher price for the Cannery or Park View rooms versus the interior rooms.
