Not so Grand

Would you expect a room in a hotel like this to have a connecting door to your neighbor? I didn't. So it was quite a surprise for me to hear him trade creche figurines over the phone late at night. Even more of a surprise was to hear from the night manager that I was the first person ever to complain...To cut it short: I had the chance to move to another room after pushing for it. As long as you make sure your room isn't connected to others it's a decent hotel in a convenient location for tourism and doing business with the government. Service in the Vox restaurant is good.
