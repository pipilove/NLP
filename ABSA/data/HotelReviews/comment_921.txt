Displeased with staff

This hotel has been so well-regarded over the years that I found it very disappointing that the staff ignored my emails. I made a reservation months in advance and had to cancel it due to my traveling companion's change in travel plans. I sent the hotel one email on Sept. 3rd explaining the situation and that I would like a cancellation confirmation. Usually someone replies to emails within 24 to 48 hours. Two days passed and I received no reply. I then sent numerous emails during the week of Sept. 6th from my various email addresses both at home and at work. The emails I sent at work gave me notification that someone at the hotel read them. Yet I never got any acknowledgement from the hotel during this time.Finally I decided that I will fax the hotel and inform them that I will not be responsible if they charge my credit card the first night's deposit (as a no-show) as I have tried many times to get a cancellation from them. If that didn't work I was going to call them. Amazingly the hotel sent on Sept. 10th emails to all of my email addresses claiming they had emailed me several times during the week with my cancellation confirmation. In their email there was a cancellation confirmation (it was not an attachment) dated Sept. 4th. I don't believe the hotel ever sent me any cancellation confirmation emails during the week as they claim. For one thing it's peculiar that I received their emails dated Sept. 10th and nothing else before that so I know it's not that my server rejected their emails. Also no one at the hotel bothered to acknowledge that they read the emails I sent from my work address.In short, I am sure many people will disagree with me as the hotel has a good reputation, but I find the staff did not act professionally in my situation.
