Standard doubles are tiny, dark, and nosy.

Pleasant staff, pleasant public rooms, pleasant breakfast BUT if you stay here do not stay in a standard double room-- either stay in a superior room or suite or go to another hotel. The standard doubles are small (like a NYC maid's room), the double bed JUST fits, our room looked out on a small dark courtyard. The room was stuffy but the courtyard was noisy as it looked out on the kitchen and office. To upgrade was about $140/night.So, my recommendation is stay someplace else unless you can afford a higher level room. There is NOTHING more depressing on a vacation than having a tiny, dark, noisy room which is not that cheap.
