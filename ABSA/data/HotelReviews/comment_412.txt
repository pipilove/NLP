Very nice hotel, decent location

My husband and I stayed at the Barcelona Universal Hotel for 3 nights in July. We thought the hotel is great overall.. VERY nice rooms, very spacious (which is pretty surprising, since its Europe). Bathroom was clean. The location was ok, there's a metro station right outside the hotel which proved to be very convenient. The hotel is about a 10 minute walk to La Rambla, but the side roads which you have to take are a little dirty, smelly, and dodgy.. so we took the metro instead. It's just 2 stops away, and the Catalunya Plaza is also on the same metro line. This area has lots of restaurants and shops. Information center was also here (La Rambla). The people at the front desk were not very friendly.. but we noticed this throughout our trip in Spain. We reached the hotel early (around 1030) but were asked to wait until 330 for a room. They let us leave our luggage at the hotel though, until our room was ready. They have a basic gym and a pool, though the pool is extremely small. Free internet facility too, which is normally not occupied. Breakfast was included in our package, and we thought it was pretty good.The hotel is good overall, and we would definitely recommend it!
