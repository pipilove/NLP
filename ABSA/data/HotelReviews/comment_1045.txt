Overbooked ?!?

First we were quite pissed about the fact fact that we booked another hotel and had to stay in your hotel. But the nice room, very friendly people (specialy matthieu Croisiez) and good location let us forget this very soon. So no comments at all and we have hade en excellent weekend. Thanks!
