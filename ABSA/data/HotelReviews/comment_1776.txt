Ew, thin walls!

Great location (for Seattle Center), clean rooms, comfy beds, large bathroom. But the walls were paper thin!!First night we heard the cleaning people at 6 am (woke us up)! Vacuuming, moving dishes around etc. The second night around midnight--for 2 hours--we had to listen to the people next to us having s*x. No matter how loud we turned up the Tele, we could still hear this women's voice. Not a pleasant experience, I can still hear her voice in my head 2 days later!!If you stay here, get a room that will be isolated or else expect to get little to no sleep!!
