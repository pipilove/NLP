Fab location yet still quiet indoors

Stayed with my partner for 3 nights at the Royal Ramblas Hotel in Barcelona. The hotel was easy to find and one of the best locations. Room was large and bright and thankfully the aircon worked as it was very hot outside. No noise at all from the street. One small niggle was the low water pressure in the shower but overall, a great hotel which allowed us a late checkout for a small surcharge. We did not eat in the hotel so cannot comment on the food.
