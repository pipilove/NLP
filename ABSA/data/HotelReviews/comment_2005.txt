Definitely not a 5 star hotel

The rooms are nice however the service is lacking to the nth degree. From the moment I checked in it seemed there were problems. Small room even though I supposedly had been upgraded. The valet parking was nothing short of a nightmare. I stayed there 6 days and I think that the staff lost my car on almost every single occassion. On one occasion I was late for a lunch date. I definitely would not recommend this hotel.
