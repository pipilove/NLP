An interesting, quirky, very friendly little hotel.

Great location PositivesThe location of this hotel is perfect. 100 yards from Anne Frank's house and on the edge of the beautiful Jordaan area. Also only 5 minute walk down to the Dam.Really friendly staff, who thankfully carried our bags up and down the stairs, remembered our names and provided us with plenty of free drinks.NegativesWe had a deluxe room and it was quite small, pretty basic and the smallest single bed I have ever slept in (since I was about 5 anyway). Breakfast not overly exciting, but there is a great pancake shop below the hotel which I would recommend.The stairs are very steep (as I suspect is the case with many hotels in Amsterdam), no lift, not really a problem for us but would be if you had young children or weren't too mobile.Overall a nice little hotel, very clean, very friendly. I would def stay here again as it's a great location and the staff are so friendly. Rooms are a little quirky and small so don't expect too much but it is definitely value for money.
