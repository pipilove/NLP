A Good Option for the 7th

I stayed at the Le Walt in mid July this summer. The staff was very helpful and accomodated all of our requests. The hotel itself has small rooms like many in Paris. Sound carries in the small hallways. I was awoken by other guests who were loud and partying at 2:00 a.m not once but several times as the door to the stairs kept opening and closing.The breakfast is very good and the coffee is excellent. They used to have a restaurant for dinner but no longer. As for location, in the 7th it's hard to beat. The Ecole Militaire Metro stop is right out of the front door. Ask for a courtyard room. Rooms on busy Le Motte Piquet may have late night street noise from the bar next door.
