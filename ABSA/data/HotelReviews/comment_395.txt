Very Dissapointed!! Do not stay here!

My partner and I stayed here for 3 nights and were very dissapointed with this hotel. It is classed as a 4 star hotel and this is definatly not the case, the rooms are very basic, decoration is extremly dated and the rooms smelt damp. The fixtures and fittings inside the rooms were poorly maintained. The photos of Hotel Royal are very deceptive. The restaurant that the hotel recommend La Poma is awful, do not eat here! Although the hotel is situated in the heart of Las Ramblas, there are plently of very nice hotels situated here too! For the price of the hotel, I would have expected more. The rooms are NOT sound-proofed, although they do block out the noice of the street, they do not block out the noice from the rest of the hotel, as we were woken early every morning by other guests. You can hear everything your neighbours are doing! I would not recommend this hotel to anyone, nor would I class it as a 4 star hotel!
