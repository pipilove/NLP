Great Hotel!!

We went to Barcelona for our wedding anniversary. We chose this hotel after reading the reviews on here and were not disappointed. The location is excellent right on La Rambla, but the rooms (or at least our room) are still very quiet, we couldn't hear the street at all. We paid extra for a &quot;deluxe&quot; room which was a bit smaller than I was expecting, but still very nice with everything you needed. The spa area was also very good with a small pool, jacuzzi's, sauna and steam room. This was great after a busy day sightseeing.I would definitely recommend this hotel.
