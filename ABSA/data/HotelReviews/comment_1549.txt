Great location, but sub-par suites

We wanted a reasonably priced hotel in the middle of Seattle, and we certainly got that. We got one of the suites on the 4th floor, and I've got to say that it was in desperate need of an update (and I'm not picky). It seemed like they were updating some of the other floors, but they didn't get to that one yet. Essentially they took 3 rooms and knocked down the walls to make a suite. Unfortunately, they only left 1 bathroom and you had to walk through the bathroom to get to 1/2 the bedrooms. It certainly makes it inconvenient when someone is using the bathroom! It reminded me of a few apartments I had right out of college.On the good side, it was in a great location, and I never felt unsafe. It's obvious that it attracts a younger crowd. When we checked in, it looked like the 1st day of college dorm check in.I would probably return, but opt for smaller rooms on the updated floors before going for the suite.
