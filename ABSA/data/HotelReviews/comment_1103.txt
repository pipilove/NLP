Nice hotel, but not love at first sight.

We read all of the reviews on this website before visiting this hotel a few weeks ago. We opted to upgrade our room to one with a larger bathroom based on recommendations of other users. This was our first trip to Paris, but our bathroom was very small and I was a bit surprised by this. Not worth the upgrade! Anyway, the view was amazing from the fifth floor (room 55) and the hotel certainly was charming. The location is great but we only discovered how close we were to incredible nightlife during the last day of our visit (our fault I guess). Less than two blocks away, across from the Trinity Church, is an amazing little bakery that has fantastic pressed sandwiches on baguettes. We picked up sandwiches before heading to Versailles and ate them on a bench just outside. The room itself was very dated, but completely clean. The television only really worked when it felt like it, but I guess you don't go to Paris to watch TV! It is a very noisy hotel, but we didn't really experience too many problems at night. The elevator is only big enough for two at the most, so we had to load all of our bags and walk up to the fifth floor, then unload. The staff is not very friendly, and I really did try to speak French with them (maybe it's my fault)! It sounds like I am complaining a lot here, but we really were satisfied with our stay. We had a fantastic vacation and I have no serious complaints. I think on our next trip to Paris, we'll try somewhere else. This one is a mixed bag -- if you want to be very comfortable, you may want to consider staying elsewhere.
