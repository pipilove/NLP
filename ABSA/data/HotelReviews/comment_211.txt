querky hotel - love the stairs

On arrival at the door way under the arcade I pressed the door entry buzzer, and the door lock was released, we started to walk up the stairs, an oh boy were they steep - but then it was a traditional Amsterdam building and I knew it would have steep stairs - it was one of the reasons we choose to stay there. A lovely surprise was the bouquet of fresh flowers in the room. The shower room was very economical with space, but all aspects, shower, toilet and sink were in working order and clean. Will definately stay there again.
