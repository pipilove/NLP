Notr quite the Starwood Luxury I expected

I travel to Amsterdam frequently for business and have stayed at the Pulitzer several times in Fall 2007 and Winter 2008. It is very well located and impressive on arrival but it is not the 5 star experience I have had at other Starwood hotels. While it is quaint to be in an assembly of historic town houses, the up and downs it takes to get to one's room gets old. The rooms are ok. While there are desks it is a very dark to try to actually do some work. And the price for internet is absurb. The bed is the same great Westin bed that keeps us business travelers loyal to Starwood. The baths have been so-so. The neighborhood is really very nice and one of the reasons to stay at this hotel. However, I have now located another hotel nearby that is about half the price but with even more charm.
