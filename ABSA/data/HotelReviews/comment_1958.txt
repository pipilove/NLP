Good Location

Swissotel Sydney is in a great location and the unusual hotel entrance is no problem.Our first impession of the reception area was very good nice and open and modern.Check in was very smooth and even though we arrived at 8.00am our room was ready.The room on the 22nd floor gave good views over the city and was spacious and well presented.The room had a large comfortable bed good size flat screen tv and space for a sofa as well as a desk.The bathroom was large and very clean with both a bath and seperate shower and was very impressive.Overall the service from all the staff was very good especailly on the lounge floor,this is well worth the extra cost.The only problem and issue was with regard to the bed linen,the sheets on the bed and duvet cover were not that new to say the least but housekeeping swifly sorted this out ,however the replacement bed cover was still stained and had frankly seen better days.I would expect a better attention to detail in a hotel of this standard.Apart from this fairly minor issue I must say trhat this is the best hotel I have stayed in ,in Sydney and would use it again.
