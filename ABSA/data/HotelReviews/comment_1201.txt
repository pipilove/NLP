Don't stay at this hotel!

What a huge disappointment! When I first checked in I was very optimistic. I was willing to overlook the fact that my shower didn't drain properly or the fact that the bedding was a major step below the major hotels because I like to stay at boutique hotels when possible. I stayed at Hotel Rex for 3 nights on business. When I returned to the hotel on my third night, at approximately 11:00PM, my key didn't work. I went down to the front desk only to find out that they had MOVED MY BAGS AND ALL OF MY PERSONAL BELONGINGS TO A DIFFERENT ROOM WITHOUT MY PERMISSION! Needless to say I was extremely upset. The manager proceeded to tell me that the room I was in was booked for a wedding party and they had no choice but to move me to another room. They claim they made several attempts to contact me however I never received a phone call, one e-mail was sent however I didn't receive it! Regardless, I am still furious over this! Never before in my 20+ years of travel have I been treated this way. They offered to comp my 3rd night, nice gesture hey! I urged the manager to comp my entire stay or I was going to fight this with AMEX to no avail, they were so pompus that they in fact billed me for my first two nights...Business travelers beware! If it happened to me, it can happen to you...Stay at the Grand Hyatt right across the street. It's cheaper and the rooms are much nicer!
