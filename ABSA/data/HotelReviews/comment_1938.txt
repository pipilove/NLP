Overpriced and shocking service

We stayed at the Swissotel Sydney for 5 nights this April as part of a month long honeymoon trip around Australia and it was by far the worst hotel in terms of value, service and overall experience during the whole trip.Positives - large nicely fitted bathrooms, excellent location, helpful concierge staffNegatives - terrible housekeeping - evidence only of bedmaking and towel changes only (examples brought to the attention of Pamela - duty manager of same toothpaste stain by sink for whole duration of trip, bathroom floor clearly not mopped, used wine glasses and cups not cleared away, amenities not replaced...overflowing sanitary bins in lobby toilets, leaking ceiling in the gym dripping onto the crosstrainer...the list goes on) overpriced additional services eg. internet and laundry more than double that of any other hotel during our stay, appalling breakfast staff eg. having to remind them to replenish bread/cheese/pastries as the buffet plates were regularly left empty.Disappontingly, even after raising our concerns with the duty manager, the toothpaste stain by the sink and dirty cups remained until the end of the trip demonstrating Swissotel in Sydney can't even get the basics of hospitality right.
