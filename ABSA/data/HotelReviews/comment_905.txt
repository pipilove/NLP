A Parician legend

We just came back from Paris after we have spend three nights at this exceptional hotel. We normally stay at the Ritz Hotel but this time we have desided to stay at the Four Seasons George V. It is not easy to compare the two hotels as they are both prestige and world famous. The Ritz is smaller but it has more original French style rooms as well as, is in a better location and more near to everything. The only problem is that if you like the night life and also to see more people walking about during the night then you defently have to stay at the George V Hotel. Everything about this hotel is perfection; exceptional rooms, friendly staff prestige public areas with gleaming floors, 19th-century furniture and paintings, unique 17th-century Flemish wall tapestries, glittering chandeliers, and spectacular flower arrangements in the public areas by the world famous floral designer Jeff Leatham. During our stay we had a deluxe room on the 7th floor with the Eiffel Tower View. We also had twice dinner at the hotel's elegant dressed in grey and gold restaurant Le Cinq. The food is exceptional and the waiters very, very frendly. To be honest the staff here are more friendly than in the Ritz's Espandon restaurant. We also had two Spa treatments each which we have found to be very good. The swimming pool is smaller than the Ritz's hotel but it is also very very nice and luxurious. Today back in London we can only say that we shall defently go back to the Four Seasons George V Hotel, not only because it is defently the most prestige hotel in Paris but also for its exceptional service and friendly staff.
