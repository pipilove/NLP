My Seattle Home Away From Home

Stayed here for business trip and of course as much fun as can be packed in between meetings. Seattle is a great city and this is the best hotel to stay. Service is impeccable, the room was terrific with a marble bath and shower. The view was incredible of the Pacific and the city from a high floor. I also love the Hyatt bedding and the ipod clock radios. This is a terrific hotel in a great location with a staff who aims to please from the front desk to the bellman. I have stayed at this hotel for 3 days now and before for a week and it does not tire. The location is close to sites, shopping and restuarants. Hands down, one of the best hotels, hotel rooms that I have stayed in. I will continue to stay here if I have to travel to Seattle.One suggestion though - how about wireless internet access throughout the hotel, even in the meeting rooms if you are paying for access in your room?
