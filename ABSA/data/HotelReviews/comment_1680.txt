Nice artsy option

The good: Location: 15 minute walk (or less) to Pike Place market, downtown; monorail ride to the space needle and experience music project (a must!). Great decor: Creative, interesting and fun with original artwork and photography all over the hotel and rooms. Not your sterile Marriott.The buts:-For the over $200 we paid per night, you should get free wireless (they offer but charge you $12/day for it). -Rooms can be on the small side with funky shapes.-AC is a wall unit - which is fine, but not quite as nice.Net result: We were happy with our choice - I would be very happy paying $120-$150 a night, less so as you get up towards $200+.
