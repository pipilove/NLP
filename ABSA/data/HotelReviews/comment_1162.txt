Great Staff = Good Hotel

The staff at the Hotel France Albion was really great! They planned trips for us to take and would call around to get us into the things we really wanted to see.... we had decided that we would wait until we got there to try to book the appointments, which is a bad idea, but the staff made it happen for us! We went on a very romantic river dinner boat cruise on the seine which was amazing plus we got to take in a show at the Moulin Rouge which was very entertaining and not trashy at all. You can walk to the Moulin Rouge from the hotel... plus we loved a dining facility near the hotel that they suggested yummy yummy yummy... it was a little pricy but soooo good! The staff spoke English well and was great. Only things we did not enjoy about staying at this hotel was that we did have to get on the metro station a lot to see the major sites, we witnessed people peeing on the street as we walked home two nights in a row, we were not in a high tourist part of town so the locals in a grocery store hated us, we had to leave our hotel key with the front desk every time we left which made us a little nervous, and the hotel was not easy to find if you did not get off the metro at the exact stop. I would suggest staying in this hotel because of the staff because the two women we dealt with were wonderful!! They were perfect and made the experience awesome. Even with the few negatives I listed above I would stay at this hotel again because we are young and did not mind some of the things that went on that were not so wonderful. The pros overcome the cons!
