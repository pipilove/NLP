Willing to give a second chance

We stayed at the Majestic in November 06,The room was quite small and dark (overlooking a fire escape) for the price paid but it was very clean and the staff was very helpful. We are planning to visit the hotel again in January 08 and have book a superior room which I am hoping is a bigger and brighter room than before. We said we would give the hotel a second chance as the staff made a lasting impression on both my self and my wife We arrived around 11am and checked in straight away no problem which was great. The location is great with plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance. Overall we enjoyed your visit which is why we have chose to stay again but would not be impressed if the room size is not greatly improved.
