Awesome!

Really liked the reviews of this hotel and delighted to see that they actually take the time to respond to some of the comments people make! Shows they take pride in what they do!! So we booked it and very pleased we did.Staff were very friendly and very helpful. Location was fabulous and the hotel amenities were brilliant. Particularly like the on-tap tea and coffee available in the lobby all day - lovely to come back to a nice cup of tea in the afternoon! The bedroom was very clean and tidy. I have to say, I was really worried about the fact I'd neglected to ask for a quiet room and we were then given a room on the 3rd floor overlooking the street. However, I needn't have worried because once the windows were closed, you could hardly hear a thing except for the ding ding of the cable cars - great double glazing!! No problem with there only being a ceiling fan instead of AC either (I find AC units are difficult to regular and just end up making me ill).Overally, great location, great service, great value for money. Definitely would stay here again!!
