Great location, staff and room

I was only there for one night before flying back to the states but after seeing the location (not too far from the Central Station but not too close), the room and being greeted by the friendly staff, I wanted to stay longer! I had a view of the canal from my good-sized room (as opposed to many European rooms that are rather cramped). There's a charming library on the ground floor to watch the world go by while having tea. I've stayed in a number of hotels in A'dam but I'll be going back to Estherea from now on.
