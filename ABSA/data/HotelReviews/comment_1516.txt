A Night at the Warwick

The rooms at the Warwick were nice. They were clean, comfortable and quiet. However, there was nothing exceptional about them. The restaurant was also nice and the food was good. The staff, on the other hand, was not pleasant or helpful. In fact there was one member of the staff who was outright rude. I felt like I was in their way when checking in and asking questions. I would recommend the Warwick to someone looking for a reasonable priced hotel, but don't expect too much.
