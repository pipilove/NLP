Great Hotel

We stayed at the Hotel Lanlois and thoroughly enjoyed it.The price was very reasonable, at the time, and the hotel and our room were very clean.The bathroom was very nice, and the room was spacious enough. All European hotel rooms are rather small; but, our room did not make us feel claustrophobic.We also found the staff to be very friendly.The elevator is a very tight squeeze, if you have an overabundance and oversized luggage. You may have to make a couple of trips.I would not only reccommend this hotel; but, would also stay again and again on subsequent visits.
