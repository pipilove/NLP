It's a no go!

A drab, dark and depressing hotel with an odor of animal, mould and old perfume. Floor un-hoovered. Bedspread stained. Handprints on the wall. Furnishings dusty and tired with a few cigarette burns here and there. Bathroom in need of urgent refurbishment. No toilettries. Toast with marmelade or peanut butter, cereal, milk, orange juice and coffe/tea for breakfast.
