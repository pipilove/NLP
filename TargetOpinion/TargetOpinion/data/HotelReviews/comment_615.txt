Schizophrenic Hotel...

My wife and I stayed two nights at this hotel at the end of February. The carnival was in full swinging in Berlin, but not in this hotel. Granted, as you enter the lobby you feel that you are entering into a great hotel. The lobby is beautiful and has a luxurious feel, with a loveably staircase, but the luxury ends right there. The schizophrenic state starts as you begin walking to your room, what an awful smell in the corridor. I concur with previous reviews; I felt I was walking through a sewer. Then you enter the room. A twin bedded room, and I mean twin and small beds. Really separate beds. Request for change was denied, notwithstanding my Starwood card. No heavenly pillows; no heavenly beds; and no heavenly comforters here. I felt I was staying at a **star hotel room. Then you enter the bathroom. It must have been decorated by the owner of a hospital. It was all white, with no goodies. I accept, however, that we had a balcony and a great view unto the Unter den Linden, but that was it. In conclusion, this is no *****star hotel. If you get a great rate per night, like I did using a voucher system, is OK, but otherwise stay elsewhere.
