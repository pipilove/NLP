Good Location but staff were unfriendly and rude

Stayed for 8 nights at the beginning of the month. Chose hotel for location and price. When I arrived (after an early morning flight), the staff member that checked me in didn't greet me, and appeared to be in a bad mood and proceeded to rable off their policies, procedures, etc with no eye contact, just a blank stare. Room wasn't ready and when I asked when one would be, she just shrugged her shoulders and said come back in a couple of hours to see if one would be ready. (OK I arrived in the morning and check -in was at 2pm, however she could have made more of an effort to see if there was any empty rooms). Coming back, my intended room wasn't ready and so I had to settle for one on a smoking floor (I'm a non smoker). Room was adequate and comfortable.Checking out, again I experienced the inhospitable attitude of the staff, my checkout was done as if it was an inconvenience to the staff member,Overall the hotel is OK, however having stayed at Travelodge Southbank in Melbourne, I experienced far better service there, then I did here. I wil not be using the hotel again when I travel to Sydney in the future
