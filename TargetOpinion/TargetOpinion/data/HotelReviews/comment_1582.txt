Best downtown location

We go to Seattle often, but this was the first time we stayed at the Sheraton. I chose it because of the positive reviews I read on TripAdvisor, the fantastic promo they had on their website ($129 + tax for the weekend) and the location.I was really impressed with their renovated modern lobby, it felt similar to the W (another Starwood hotel) but larger. The staff was more mature  friendlier than the W. There's ample seating in the lobby to read the newspaper, an area of computers for guests, a takeout cafe/bakery and a restaurant/grill...from what I saw.We requested the renovated Union St Tower and were really happy with the room - decent downtown view, new furnishings, very comfortable and contemporary. There was a flatscreen TV, Starbucks coffee and Bliss products in the room.To make it even better they should add robes and a complimentary bottle of water - the tap water was too chlorinated and the mini bar bottled water was $4. The location is perfect because it's so close to Pike Place market, downtown shopping and the great restaurants in Belltown. Everything that we needed was within 1 block or 2: bank, coffee shop, pharmacy, great stores  parking.We parked in the Convention Centre lot for $24/night versus paying $35/night at the hotel. The Centre is safe because it's either packed with cars during the day or closed at night.We ate at some fantastic restaurants: Tavolata and Union. There's a cool lounge around the corner from the hotel called Vessel with great cocktails, music and interior. For breakfast we ate at the market (lots of options) but didn't have a good experience at Cafe Campagne...we waited 45 min for breakfast and then it was served cold. To top it off they weren't too apologetic.
