OK but maybe needs a few tweaks!

This hotel is huge!! But one of the worse things about it - the elevator. It goes so fast that it actually makes you feel sick and not only that, you can wait 10 mins or so for one to come and they are pretty small.We had 2 rooms and couldn't get one near to each other - one was on the 3rd floor but the other on the 8th and then they asked to move our 8th floor room because of carpetting work. They moved us to a smaller room which stunk of cigarettes!! The staff weren't particuarly friendly. Although I had an amazing pedicure in the spa. The location is ok - beware of homeless people all outside though. The decor is nice, although there seems to be a few things that need updating, paint pealing etc. Would have been nice to have A/C too. Overpriced breakfast.But I have to say the beds were amazing, so comfortable. It felt like heaven!
