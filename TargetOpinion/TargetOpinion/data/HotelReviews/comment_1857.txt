No Reward points

This is a terrible hotel. The charges that they charge on your bill, you have to scrutinizes it carefully because it doesn't tally at all!The worst thing is about the rewards points. If you are staying there with a third party paying you, I would suggest you to stay in other hotels like Radisson. Marriot don't give rewards points iof it is paid by 3rd party. This is very frustrating because I choose Marriot as I though I could be rewarded. In fact I have colleagues staying in Radisson and they ware rewarded with points.I would never ask my agent to book this hotel again as this is a 'nothing' great hotel plus the services is not good either.
