Fantastic Boutique Hotel

We booked a stay in this hotel for 5 days and both found the staff and facilties to be off an exceptional nature. The staff were very friendly, helpful and non-intrusive, while the accommodation was of aunique style, perfectly suited for a getaway with a partner. Therooms were clean, comfortable and the courtyard was a great addition.The continental breakfast was a great start to a day of sightseeing and shopping, all which were located within easy walking distance. The Altamont is a hotel in which we will definitely stay again and highly recommend it to anyone visiting Sydney who are looking for a well located, friendly and unique hotel.
