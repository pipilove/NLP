Excellent!

Have just returned from a 3 night stay. Hotel staff were without exception polite and efficient. They upgraded our room to a view of the Ku'damm as it was my birthday, and on returning from a day of sightseeing I found a birthday cake in our room. Our room was large and modern with a very comfortable bed and a immaculately clean and modern bathroom. The rooms are well soundproofed - couldn't hear a thing from either side. Breakfast was included in our room rate and was very good - we just ate a big buffet breakfast each morning and didn't have to spend any euros on lunch (other than the odd currywurst!).Location is great for shopping and about a 5 minute walk to Zoo station, however it is a bit of a trek to the Reichstag etc. However, Berlin transport system is fantastic - I wish London's was as good! For 5.8 euros you can buy a day pass which covers the S and U bahn for as many journeys as you can manage. Just don't forget to validate it first! If I was to stay in Berlin again I would have no hesitation in staying at the Swissotel. A tip - we got 7.5 euro off our bill for booking through the hotel's website. This was credited against some drinks we had had at the (reasonably priced) bar.
