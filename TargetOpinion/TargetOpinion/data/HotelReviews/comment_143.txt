Not Recommended

This older hotel by the train station has not been well-maintained, and my room in particular was disgustingly dirty, with human hair all over the floor, stains on the carpet, and a filthy bathroom that had to be cleaned again immediately upon my arrival. Also, the window was broken and would not shut properly, which would make it easy for someone to break into the room (a real danger in Amsterdam, particularly where this hotel is located). When I complained the hotel staff I was treated extremely rudely; in response to my complaint a porter told me that I should just leave the hotel and stay somewhere else. To their credit, the management was more responsive and very apologetic for the condition of my room and the rude treatment by their staff. But that does not change the fact that my 1-night stay was awful; I would never stay here again and I would not recommend it to anyone. If you are looking for the convenience of this hotel's location across from the train station, be aware that this is a particularly seedy, dangerous area. In this case it is clear that this hotel's desirable location for travellers allows the hotel to get away with its shabby condition and service. If you want to me near the station but in a safer, better hotel, you should definitely pay a little more to stay at the Renaissance about 1 block away.
