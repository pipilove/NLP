Its Dinsey, what do you expect?

First of all, the front desk was most helpful. We arrived at 11 am and the bag handler told us our room would be ready by 3, enjoy the park and the bags would be placed in our room. The front desk told others the same thing. Seeing that we had just arrived from an overnight flight, they got us a room within 15 minutes and we got to rest before going to the park.You can't beat the location to the park. Period. The hotel was very expensive, but, not having to take the bus from your hotel to Disneyland...priceless...The food at breakfast, which is included, was average. The buffet dinner...if you can, skip it. Poor quality and expensive. However if you have young children they do bring in the characters, which makes it worth it. hey, it's Disneyland. Don't act like you are suprised that everything is so expensive and mediocre!!Tip...buy an autograph book as soon as you get there. Once the kids see everyone else approaching the characters, you will eventually be buying one anyway, this way they get as many autographs as they can. The characters also come to this hotel, which is nice, bc there are less of a crowd surrounding them.The park is smaller and more managable than the US. Better for smaller kids.The room was excellent quality and comfort. The pool is a bit small, but was not crowded. I hear the Sequioa has a better pool...but again you have to take the bus to Disney.Checkout was easy, housekeeping returned an expensive Chloe coat with $38 US in the pocket that I left behind...very honest.I would go again.
