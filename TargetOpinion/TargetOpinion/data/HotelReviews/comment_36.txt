Not great considering the advance communication and the price

I had communicated 6 months in advance, requesting Canal side room with access to elevator as my travelling partner was my 76 year old mother. Confirmed in email by the hotel for this advance request. Yet, arrived on date planned. Arrived at 11:00 am and requested early check in but no early check in available unless willing to pay for an additional night. Declined early check in. Assured by front desk room would be availlable by 3 pm which is the check in time. Sat and waited 4 hrs, came to desk to get checked in at 3 pm, no canal room available and no other room available at check in time. Promised room would be available as soon as possible. At 4:00 pm again addressed the desk, they then decided to upgrade our room to an executive room and we were escorted. For a 5 star hotel, this behavior is intolerable. I will never stay at this chain again.
