horrible experience- gave away my prepaid room

room not ready; prepaid executive room w/ view on exec floor and did not get my room for 4 adults; so, had to settle for small suite w/ one king bed and 2 roll away beds stuffed in this cramped room; they simply gave away my room! what a bunch of crap! they knew i was prepaid and reserved for 3 mos before and should have had MY room!!!!!!!! since i prepaid, they would not discount this lower grade roomthey were ultra busy...too busy to provide any type of quality service....sad! we were so far away from home and had to put up w/this from what i had previous thought was a quality hotel chainnever again will i trust Marriott..........and as for Hotels.com.....their prepayment requirment sucks! there are alot more hotels in this area to stay at and i would suggest one of them........
