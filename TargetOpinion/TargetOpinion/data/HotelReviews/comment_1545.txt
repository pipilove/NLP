What a deal!

I believe the Moore is the best budget hotel I've ever stayed in. I've stayed there four times over the past two or three years and every time I've been, my room has been clean and pleasant, the staff are friendly and helpful, the beds are comfortable and the location cannot be beat. I always stay in the rooms with a shared bath and I have always found the bathrooms to be in impeccable condition and I have never once had to wait for an occupied bathroom. The hotel is located in Belltown where there are great restaurants, music clubs and bars everywhere. It's a quick walk to the Public Market, downtown or the Seattle Art Museum. It's on several major bus lines that'll take you just about anywhere in the city.Just remember: the Moore is a budget hotel. You do get towels, sheets and soap, but that's it. The rooms are simple, almost bare, and it does feel like the building has seen better days. There's no overnight parking which is my only real complaint about the place especially since parking is so dang expensive. But for $60/night in downtown Seattle you can't expect luxury. What you do get, though, is a heck of a deal.
