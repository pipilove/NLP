Service and location perfect

We stayed at the hotel last december, booked directly. The location is perfect, walking distance for the shopping and all the key areas of Barcelona, the room was large and quiet, very clean, the staff is lovely and really helpful, breakfast is delicious. We recommend this hotel for people looking for a good 5 stars hotel in the center of Barcelona.
