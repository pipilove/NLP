Hard to Breathe Here

I am staying at this hotel as I write this. When I made the reservation I requested a non smoking room and had at least 4 subsequent email communications with the hotel informing them that I needed to have a non smoking room for health reasons. (If you don't like smoke you may want to stay away from Berlin!) I was given a room that did not smell of smoke but the hallway and lounge at the end of the hall were smoke infested. I called to compain and asked for a room on a non smoking floor and was told that my room was a non smoking room on a smoking floor. Needless to say I moved my room to a non smoking floor but I am still annoyed that this hotel is so insensitive to people needing or wanting clean air. The manager I spoke with was rather surly. The fron desk agents are very nice but they do not seem to want to rock the boat to assist a guest who is not happy. I am at a convention and can not get out of this hotel because of prepayment issues as well as no other hotel availability but I am not very happy at this hotel AT ALL,
