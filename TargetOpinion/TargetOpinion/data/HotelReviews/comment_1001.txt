Very disappointing, so many better choices in Paris

After having read the reviews here, we were looking forward to a great experience at this hotel, but what a joke. While one reviewer wrote the rooms are small, but this is Paris,, after having stayed in more than a dozen other hotels in Paris, many less than half of the price of this one, I can honestly say this was the tiniest hotel room I ever had. At these prices, there is simply no excuse.Yes, the location is terrific -- and that's important because you certainly can't stay in your room. There is also no place to unpack (no drawers, horrible use of space), and not even enough room to keep your suitcase on a rack.Second day there we awoke to no electricity in our room. We finally got reception to pick up the phone, and were told they'd get back to us. A half an hour later someone showed up, said they hadn't realized whole block of rooms were without power (and air circulation) but they were getting it back on. There was never the slightest apology about this.The concierge is a waste -- the only bad meal we had in Paris was his recommendation, and the breakfast in the hotel, at 29 Euros, is insane -- and not much too it. There are numerous cafes in the area, while also pricey, offer a decent petit dejeuner for around 10 Euros instead.We used Marriott points so shouldn't complain this much, but friends stayed there as well and they were really ripped off.Believe me, we stayed at a hotel for half the price on the Left Bank, had a sense of true Paris, great, large room, with a view, impeccable service -- and the room rate was less than half of this.Don't settle for an inferior experience -- if you are only comfortable in chain hotels, Westin around the corner and the Hilton on the left bank (where rooms are also twice the size) are far superior choices. A horrible experience...
