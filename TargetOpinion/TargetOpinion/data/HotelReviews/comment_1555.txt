Moore hotel good value for Canadians!

Visited Seattle first time in August- to bicycle with cascade bike club up to Vancouver ( 180km).The Moore hotel was clean and allowed my bicycle into the room- it was only 2 blocks from the Pike market which had all kinds of healthly foods. It is older but well kept, the fan they lend you helped with the road noise and heat. It is well priced for canadians who are spending candadian dollars. The young fellow at front desk was a pleasure to talk with.I will be doing this ride each summer and staying at this motel.It was an adventure cycling from the airport to downtown- midday is the ony time to attemtp this.thanks again Moore hotel!!Paul
