Great Hotel !!

We recently spent 3 nights at the Tuscan. Nice, medium sized hotel in a good location. Walking distance to all Fishermans's Wharf attractions, cable cars, etc. Very good Italian resturant attached (forgot the name). Wine tastings each afteroon. The staff is friendly and helpful. The room is medium size, clean and comfortable. I SUGGEST YOU REQUEST A COURTYARD ROOM TO AVOID THE STREET NOISE. This IS a city!
