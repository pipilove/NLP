Strobe lights...

This 100-year-old hotel has a great location and impressive lobby, with nice crown mouldings as one reader pointed out.Unfortunately you can't sleep in the lobby. I stay in over 100 nights a year in Starwood hotels around the world and have seen some great Westins. But this is not one of them. As such a frequent guest I was put into a handicap accessible room, which means no separate shower, and strobe lights went off in the room when somebody rang my doorbell. If they treat their best guest this way, imagine what kind of room you'll get.No water in the room unlike other Westins. And the kicker is, when I called down in the morning to request a local newspaper, I was told you can buy it downstairs. This is the only Westin in the world that does not give you a copy of newspaper to their Starwood Platinum guest. Truly amazing.I used to stay here in the late '80s and early '90s, and was always impressed with the hotel. So I was really looking forward to this return trip in over 10 years. Unfortunately so much has changed. This hotel has past its prime. I quickly cancelled my 6-night stay the following month. I think at the Park Hyatt they understand the value of a returning guest. You can find better options in San Francisco.
