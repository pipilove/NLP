Excellent location BUT .....

I agree with all that has been said by previous guests about the location but unless you ask for a suite (and pay the corresponding price), premium rooms are VERY small. There is only one chair for two people, the bath is really a sitting bath but not high enough for that and the toilet just big enough for small children. Separate shower okay. And all this at a very stiff price! Staff very friendly. Breakfast at an exorbitate price but there are plenty of small places within three minutes walk. Shall certainly not return because the price/performance ratio is poor.
