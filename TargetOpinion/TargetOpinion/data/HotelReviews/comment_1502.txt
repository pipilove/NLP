Noisy

The hotel is well located within the downtown core but the traffic and street noise is very loud. We were on the 7th floor and could hear people talking on the street across from the hotel. City buses just waiting at the bus stop could be heard running in the room all night long. Parking was expensive and there was no elevator in the parkade so if you have any mobility problems you need to use the valet parking.
