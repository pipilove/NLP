Expecting too much?

After reading all the eulogistic reviews of the Hotel Montecarlo, perhaps we were expecting a little too much of this good (but not fantastic) hotel. We came away a little deflated but well rested after a 3 night stay. Firstly, the positives - The frontdesk staff were attentive, helpful and knowledgable. The room was clean (but see other comments later), the towels and robes very comfortable and the jacuzzi bath good fun. The adjustable bed was very good for elevating the feet after a long walking day. The hotel's position halfway along La Rambla is perfect. Now the disappointments - The room (403) was very small with no dressing table nor mirror, except in the bathroom where it was regularly steamed up. Tea / coffee making facilities would have been nice also. The carpet was very badly marked and stained including several cigarette burns. The furniture was cheap, shoddy and likewise stained. Our window view was of a blank wall 10m away. We asked to be moved and offered to pay for an upgrade but the hotel was full. We paid 190 Euros for the room per night directly booked with the hotel. The bar was very basic, lacked comfort and atmosphere. It was rarely staffed so you had to interupt the frontdesk for service. Here I admit to being ultra-critical and this probably doesn't matter to most people. However, we like to have a relaxing glass of beer or wine at the end of the day and in the evenings.All in all it was a fairly pleasant place to stay (no better than that) and a deluxe room, rather than basic, is definately recommended.
