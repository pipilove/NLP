fantastic stay

The Pulitzer was recommended to me by a colleague who had stayed there. We stayed for 4 nights in a superior room. I did look at some of the reviews before I went and wasn't sure what to expect. We had a fantastic stay and loved the hotel. Our room was excellent, yes they are narrower than avereage but they are finished very well. It was the best bed I have slept in away from home. The bathroom was lovely as well. I had a look in a standard room which was v similar just a little shorter.The communal lounge/bar is a lovely space. V relaxing, an oasis of calm in a very busy town. The restaurant is equally nice and breakfast was very fresh with a good selection of hot and cold food. We also ate there one night and the standard was equally as good. There is a nice outside terrace area as well. There is a great roof terrace bar which is open from 6 onwards.The over all experience was excellent. We are pretty fussy about where we stay and the standards of service we expect and the team at ther Pulitzer surpassed them. The stay were very friendly and polite and its a v central location.
