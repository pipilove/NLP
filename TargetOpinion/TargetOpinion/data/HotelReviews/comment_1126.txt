Great hotel, costly, but worth it

Perfect location, beautiful hotel, but it should be for the price you pay. Right at the gates to the park which is the number one benefit, so when the kids get tired you can just pop back for a rest. Lovely room. Chocolate coins placed on beds at night, kids loved that. The only downside was breakfast which was served from 7.30am and by 8.30 you have to wait for a table. Breakfast is a buffet with possibly the worst sausages i have ever tasted, cereal choice for kids not great , bacon greasy, bread toaster didn't appear to work after me trying twice and having three members of staff at the machine look at it and bread still came out not toasted which they thought was fine. The best thing about breakfast was the fact we took apples and banana's away with us. For france having the best chefs in the world, i have never tasted such poor food and my god you had better stock up on juice and water before you return to hotel because the they must bring in the salt to the parks on trucks. Kids t.v chanels all in french, no tea and coffee facilities in room. But i still think fab holiday, magical, just shame about the food.
