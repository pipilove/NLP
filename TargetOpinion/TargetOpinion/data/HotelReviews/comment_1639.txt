I used to like this place... what happened????

When the W Seattle originally opened, it was a great new hotel. I was coming to Seattle every month for work and loved each and every time I stayed there. My job finished and I had not been to Seattle for the past two years. I had the chance to come up to Seattle for a July vacation and unfortunately I picked the W. I am sitting in my room right now and waiting to check out and go somewhere else. This would be two days early. I am an easy going person, but this visit to the W has been a nightmare. I am not going to go into details, but I can honestly state that I have never been so upset that I demanded to leave a hotel early. I don't even have a replacement hotel, but I am very happy to leave this place.The room was OK, the location great... but the SERVICE.... I think the staff here are still waiting for the training from corporate. I am still upset that they could not do anything right. Especially since we were paying full rates to stay here over the 4th. I used to love this place and hope that anyone who is considering the W Seattle will think twice.
