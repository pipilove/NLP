Excellent location

My partner and I spent four nights here recently. The room was reasonably clean, reasonably sized. Staff was very friendly. We had trouble figuring out exactly how the air conditioning worked. Whether you like the omnipresent Warhol theme and the colouring scheme (lots of lime green and yellow) is a question of taste I guess. What we DEFINITELY liked was the location. The hotel is just off the main shopping mile of Ku'damm, halfway between the big department stores around the Kaiser Wilhelm church and the more upmarket shops at the lower end of Ku'damm.
