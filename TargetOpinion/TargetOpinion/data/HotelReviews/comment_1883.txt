High quality hotel in business district

Stayed here for a week on business. Good quality hotel central to the business district and on the edge of Darlng Harbour with plenty of restaurants and bars.Ask for a harbour view (and insist on it being free - as they will concede eventually) as the view is superb.Good rates including breakfast (which is excellent). Would recommend this to anyone.Location is about 2 streets from the main tourist areas and a 20 minute walk from the old town.
