Perfect for Lilliputians

I was in Seattle for a conference in June and spent three nights here. The room was a double, ie, two beds and I was travelling with my spouse. There was not enough room for us to unpack anything and so little floor space that I could not leave my suitcase filled and accessible (not even under the bed). I contacted the front desk for additional hangers so that I could at least hang my things. I'm a light packer but was completely stymied by the inability to put my things away. The bathroom was the smallest I have ever used. The stall shower was not large enough to bend elbows much less shave legs, etc. Plus, the shower curtain was black and so there was no light in the stall. Sink was like an airplane sink. Ridiculously small. Do not attempt to wash your face using such a fixture. Plus it was in your lap when you sat down on the toilet. Staff was friendly and courteous but nothing could compensate for the size of the facilities. Great location, comfortable beds but I will never go back.
