wonderful stay 

I booked our stay via Expedia from the Uk based on much research and previous traveller reviews. We were not disappointed. From check in to check out we had a wonderful stay. Our rooms and bathrooms were spotlessly clean, well equipped and had fantastic views. Slippers and robes were a nice touch.Taking the club rooms and club lounge option was certainly worth the extra. A delightful haven to begin the day with breakfast or start the evening with drinks and canapes. Attentive and well informed staff. Parking was an issue but a valet dealt with that for us even though the rates were a little steep. I suppose it is right in the city centre after all! The location is perfect. Central for all the sights, rail and ferries. We will be visiting Sydney again next year and there is no doubt about which hotel we would use. J  A B UK
