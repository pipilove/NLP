Great friendly place to stay

Nob Hill Inn is a really good place to stay. The owners know almost everything there is to know about San Francisco - they'll tell you where to visit (and where not to) and how to get there. The rooms are large and comfortable (your above average standard room really). If you have a car, you can park here, which is a real bonus in a city where parking is limited. The Inn is fairly well located - although it's in a residential area, so there's not a great deal of nightlife. There are some nice little restaurants nearby as you walk towards Hyde. Muni travel passes (the 3 day passes are a real bargain if you plan to be in the city that long) can be bought from the Holiday Inn on Van Ness. This Inn has a good reputation and when we were there it was fully booked and it seemed that the majority of the guests had been there before which is always a good sign. Definitely to be recommended if you want a standard room in a handy location.
