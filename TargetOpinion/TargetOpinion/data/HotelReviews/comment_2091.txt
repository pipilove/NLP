Definitely NOT a 5 star hotel

The facilities, if they were OPEN, would have been good I'm sure! The Reception desk and welcome was basic, pleasant but definitely basic. Front door staff/valet parking staff were fine although Valet parking cost of $45 a rip-off. There are 2 bars in the hotel, the ground floor bar is only open Wed-Fri (ridiculous). There was a wedding reception in the hotel the night we stayed, which didn't allow anyone else but the wedding guests to patron the only other bar in the hotel (this is perhaps not the Hotel's fault, but alas perhaps if the ground floor bar was opened!!). Rooms very basic, but clean and tidy at least. We didn't enter the pool/spa area as it not only looked dirty and unclean, There seemed to be no air circulation or seating suitable for a short visit upon opening the Pool door for a very, very quick peek. Not good. Generally very poor facilities for a supposed 5 star hotel.
