Amazing Property-- Do Not Miss This Hotel!!

We travel frequently and have stayed at some highly rated hotels in both larger cities (Georges V - Paris) and in smaller cities/towns) in the past, but our recent visit to this property was our best hotel experience ever. The room (Club Level Suite) was superb and the service levels -- from the Front Desk to the Concierge to the staff in the Club Lounge -- consistently were superlative. We were traveling with family and they provided adjoining rooms for us, something none of the other hotels (including other 5 star properties) were able to do. They went out of their way to cook special foods for my daughter (age 2) to ensure that she had plenty of things that she liked. Even when things did not go perfectly at first, we received an apology and they made things right. We had an amazing stay in Berlin thanks, in no small part, to the extraordinary staff at this hotel.
