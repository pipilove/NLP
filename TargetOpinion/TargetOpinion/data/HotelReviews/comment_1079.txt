Perfect Paris

This hotel was fantastic. I went in August and booked online so I got a superior room for half the usual price. I had room 45 which has an amazing view of the eiffel tower. I booked this hotel because of the good ratings on this site. I was not disappointed at all. The receptionists were really wonderful with perfect english. They were more than willing to help people figure out the metro or anything else. One found a really cheap eurostar ticket back to london for me.I was travelling this part of my trip alone and I felt that the hotel was in a really safe upscale part of town. It was quiet, especially in August as little retailers take their vacation, but I was able to walk to the Latin quarter easily. The closest metro is about 2 blocks. The hotel itself was really cute with a nice decor. Air conditioning was great and the room sizes were more than adequate. I really have nothing negative to say about this hotel and recommend it to anyone except maybe a group of young people looking to party.
