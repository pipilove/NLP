Not Your Best Bet in Sydney

Felt like we wasted a bunch of money for three nights in mid-November 2004. As mentioned, rooms were smallish but more than that - the lobby is dowdy and staff hide behind their counters. None of us ever actually had the doorman open the door for us. The rooms are also set up so there are often three doors next to each other and one can hear the foot traffic.Good: Hotel is really in Circular Quay - which means it is very convenient to Starbucks and the ferry boats. Linens were nice and the gym staff were excellent. Very relaxing private spa feel to locker room and clean equipment.Bad: Largest outdoor hotel pool in Sydney isn't saying much for Sydney. Concierge staff always glued to their headsets and never seem to finish with their other clients. Bit far if you'd like to travel to the shopping areas. I'd say try the nearby Shangri-La.
