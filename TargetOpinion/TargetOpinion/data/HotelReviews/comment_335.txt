Disappointment

What a disappointment!!! The lobby and the staff were good, but the rooms were BIG BIG disappointment - small, Motel 6 furnishings for 5 star hotel prices. Some rooms did not have a window. The pillows and towels were 1/2 sized. To get to the toilet, my broad shouldered husband had to turn sideways. The only good feature of the hotel was its location - across the street from Gaudi's Casa Bastilo and 2 blocks from Casa Meri and in the middle of the nice shopping area. The location was a good walk from Las Ramblas, which is chancy for the late night, unless you are in a group and with someone who knows their way around and speaks Catalon Spanish. Next time - somewhere else.
