Great hotel, location and friendly staff!

We stayed at the Omni hotel after reading all the reviews on Trip advisor. I have to say that they were true! The Omni hotel is a great place with a very friendly staff. We arrived early (10:30a) and a room was waiting for us. After signing up on their website, we ended up with coffee and juice delivered to our room every morning. We also had breakfast included. The restaurant was great. The staff there welcomed us each morninng and we had the choice as far as menu. I had steak and eggs one morning. Just fabulous! The meat was very tender.We will definetely stay there again. Perfect location as well.
