Never judge a book by it's cover

My friend and I stayed at the Majestic in August 2006 for 2 days. I had been to Barcelona previouusly and thought the Majestic looked beautiul from the outside and liked the location so I booked it by myself through the hotel. I found the front desk extremely unhelpful in offering any assistance upon our early arrival. I also asked them to please make a dinner reservation for us that evening and they neglected to call until late in the day at which point it was totally booked. However, they lied and said the restaurant was closed for the month of August. I sensed the lie and I called the restaurant from my room and found that the restaurant was open but fully booked. I also was very disappointed in my room. I would never go back to this hotel again. H. Seltzer (NYC)
