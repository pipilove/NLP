Not up to the Four Seasons name

You can't beat the location of the hotel--it's really convenient. Comfortable beds in ridiculously small rooms. Considering this is an older hotel, the decor is acceptable. The concierge staff is the best thing about the hotel. They are consistently helpful and attends to you immediately, well, at least the male ones do. Cab drivers may still refer to this hotel as the Regent or mistake your destination as Four Points hence it's always good to say George St after you've said Four Seasons. A lot of tour groups--especially cruises--stay here and that places a lot of stress on the staff, which is reflected in the degree of cleaniness in my room (well, they could be old stains). Horrible coffee. Breakfast buffet is average. Lunch is good.I am concerned about the competence of the front desk staff though. They are poor in customer relations and executing their job responsibilities. I will spare the details here as they are too long to write. The management keeps promising better service the next time and despite repeated stays, I have to say that there is still much room for improvement. If you don't mind climbing up a small slope, try the Shangri-La. Huge rooms with much better views than the Four Seasons. The staff is also more sincere in assisting customers and are incredibly good in team work and noticing customers' needs. This should probably go to the Shang's review.All in all, this is not your typical Four Seasons where you receive 5-star service and 5-star accomodations.
