A little bit dated

I have no doubt that 15 years ago this was the most grand hotel in Sydney. It isn't now however, but they are still charging like it is.My experience wasn't bad, in fact the staff where wonderful, the room was pleasant and the facilities where Ok, its just that when I pay just shy of $AUD400 a night I expect more.I have previously reviewed the Sheraton on the Park in Sydney and would like to add it beats the four seasons in every category quite convincingly and especially as much more often you can score a deal on one of the booking sites with it than you can at the Four Seasons.My major negative with the whole place was it is just a bit dated and they will really need to spend big dollars soon to maintain a five star rating which I personally feel rating groups give out way to freely. Another thing that caused me irritation was I was running late for a meeting and had to quickly iron a shirt. Unfortunately the room had no iron so I had to call housekeeping and 30 mins later I had my iron and I was now really late for my meeting. Why the hell wouldn't a major hotel just put an iron in the room??Other than that the other facilities such as the pool area were OK without making you feel you where at a five star establishment.Overall in no way would I rate it bad however compared to some of its peers I just felt it didn't quite measure up.
