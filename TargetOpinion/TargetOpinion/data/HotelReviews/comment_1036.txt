Big let down

We stayed over the weekend and booked a room with a view of the Arc de Triumphe. Lets just say this trip was a massive disappointment. Checked-in and went to the room to find that not only did the room not have a view of the Arc de Triumphe - it didn't have a view at all. It literally looked straight onto a white wall of the adjacent building 5 feet away. I complained at reception that I'd asked and been promised a room with a view of the Arc de Triumphe and had paid a premium - was told that all rooms were fully booked and there was no possibility of being moved. Apart from the room, the breakfast was very disappointing as well - the whole place was just a let down considering we'd been expecting such great things following the reviews here.I've visited Paris with my other half quite a few times and have always been very pleased with the quality of the hotels. What made this experience even worse was that i'd planned to pop the question, but the room put such a dampner on the whole weekend that i decided to leave it for another time. Will return to Paris but wouldn't go near this place again. Avoid, unless you like to fork out a fortune for a room with no view.
