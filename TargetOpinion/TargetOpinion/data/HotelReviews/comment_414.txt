A great place

We recently stayed at the hotel and on the whole it was great. The rooms were comfortable and modern. The pool area is located on the roof and gives a fantastic view of the city. The only problem was the lack of sun loungers. It is only a small area and a little cramped, Although the beach is located just 10 minutes walk from the hotel. There are many bars and restaurants nearby and the port is only a short walk away. It was very busy here and the night life was excellent. Every taste is catered for. A lovely market was also here.We did not see any street crime during our stay in the city but we were warned a couple of times about leaving our bags on the table. Barcelona is a beautiful place with plenty of culture. The best for me was visiting the architecture of Gaudi. The Sagrada Familia is breath taking but amazingly no where near finished after 120 years since it was started. My personel favorite was Gaudis Casa Mila built in 1906. It was a residential apartment block and one of the apartments is preserved. If you like Art Nouveau this is the place for you.
