Great location, but not much more

I was here for a week in June, and it was my fifth stay in 10 years. It has gone downhill in recent years. The nice restaurant is gone (but there are many close to the hotel). The lobby and rooms were a little shabby. I had to have lights replaced and something else repaired. It took forever to check in- only one person at the counter. I didn't get a mini bar key at check-in, or for 3 hours after requesting one (and boy did I need a beer after being delayed on Alaska Air!). I had to call 3 times for the key and 2 for the lightbulb. I got a $20 certificate for the inconvenience.Room service is very quick, but the quality is poor. Same exact food if you are at the cafe, room service or catering a banquet. I have catered events at this hotel and they used to be great. Can't beat the view on the 35th floor. This year the food was barely good.The pool is indoors upstairs and has a strong chlorine smell that wafts to the fancy ballroom.Rooms are very small. Beds are comfy. For $200 I would like a turn down and chocolate, decent room service and not have to spend a fortune on the phone or internet acess.Good location, but there are many other hotels around.
