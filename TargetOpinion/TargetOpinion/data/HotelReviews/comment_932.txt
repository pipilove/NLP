overpriced

While the staff were very nice and room comfortable the decor is a bit faded for this kind of price. The tiles where chipped around the bath and there were very few extras in the bathroom which you would expect like even a nail file. The minibar charged 4 euros for a small bottle of water or juice. While the location is great there are better prices to be had in paris. Try Le relais Gascon restaurant close by for good value food though.
