Why the high ratings for this place?

Best Western website for this hotel advertised refrigerators in every room. Because of some special food needs, we booked this hotel with this understanding, plus it had received highest rating - best hotel in Wharf area. Were here July6-9 (still here...unfortunately....)Got to hotel, disappointed in the incredibly small rooms, but location is great. Website also said rooms had been recently redecorated - guess they forgot our 2 rooms - kind of shabby. Cheap furniture. Outdated outlets - couldn't plug cell phone chargers in except one place under desk. Hair dryer in bathroom constantly fell in sink from it's holder when anyone used the door to our room. Finally unplugged it and left it down on the TINY sink are space.Worst part was no fridges in room as advertised. They had quasi mini-bars in dorm-size fridges but we were told by front desk that we could not empty them out without being charged for the contents. We asked to speak to a manager, but after an hour of waiting no one came to talk to us about this. Wanted to get on with being tourists so we decided not to wait. Asked next morning - still told we couldn't empty them - offered to pull up website on our laptop which still showed that fridges came with rooms but they didn't want to see it - they just wanted to say that there rooms never had fridges and didn't know why BW advertised that they did. They told me I would have to wait for maids to come to take stuff out of fridge later in the day - like i'm really going to waste tourist time for this. I BEGGED them to be able to just remove the things myself and leave them on the desk - they said they'd have to talk to a manager - i said great when would they be in - they said they had no idea!!!!!Totally unwilling to help us in any way. WORST BW we've ever stayed in as far as service goes.
