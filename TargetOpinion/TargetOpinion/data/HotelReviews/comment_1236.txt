location great, but not a destination hotel

We booked the Chancellor based on the rave reviews on this site; we were similarly enthralled by the location, but not terribly excited by anything else. The plumbing was loud, the room was tiny, the window opened onto a metal maze of a fire escape, the umbrella broke as soon as we opened it, and the lobby bar was the least appealing place in the city. Stay here if you want a central location and don't plan to spend much time in the room, and you'll be perfectly satisfied.
