Where was ther service

We stayed here with a few issues to mention. On the first evening we decided to eat in the hotel restaurant, never again. the food was ok but the staff werent exactly consistant with what they were doing. we initially didnt get charged for a bottle of wine nor sparkling mineral water. however the waiter realised and broguht us another bill about 15 minutes later. Understandably they were busy but in the world of technology how did we get served the wine and water without it going through a system, definately not sure. We used the automated check-in system which overcharged our card but management seemed apologetic even though reception didnt really careThey have a long way to improve but maybe slowly getting there.The location was fantastic
