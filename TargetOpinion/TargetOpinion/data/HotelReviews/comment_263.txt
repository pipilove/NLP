Characterless hotel with average facilities

The hotel was very central (off Dam Square and near the central railway station), but not on or particularly near to a canal. Decor was bland and businesslike, with no sense of being in Holland. For business use, it was fine (and there's a free computer room for guests on the 1st floor), but if you're there for tourism you might want something with some character. I was put in a small, dark, smoking room (which smelled of smoke), but got changed to a larger room on the third floor (only three floors are non-smoking). The room was spacious, but the view was of a wall and had little natural light. This seems to be typical of most of the rooms, unless you go for a suite. There was still an ingrained smell of smoke in the room, even though it was non-smoking, and there were two cigarette burns on the bedspread. The staff were very helpful, and the breakfast was good (though it wasn't included in the room rate, and cost an extra 20 euros). Breakfast isn't available as room service. All in all, this is an adequate hotel, but I'm surprised it's part of the Raffles International group of hotels, as it was very functional and in need of a facelift.
