very dissapointed

I was very upset!!! the room was dirty we asked to be shown another room that room as well was not very clean we stayed only one nite and moved to the westin for the next nite. If the housekeeping staff can't wipe the toothpaste splatter off the bathroom walls what else have they not done.
