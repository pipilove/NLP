Noisy, expensive, small rooms..

We arrived at the hotel sunday at 15.00, and our room was not ready. Ok, fair enough, the hotel asked if we would like them to store our luggage, which we would. We got back two hours later, and had to wait 25 minutes to check in, because the reception was crowded with guests. After this we had to wait another 20 minutes to get our luggage up in our room, and we went down THREE times to ask where it was. We also said that we could bring it up ourselves if they were short of staff. No respond.. I think we got the worst room in the whole hotel. 2nd floor (1st floor is restaurant), tiny room, and our window faced a backyard, which in fact just was a hollow room inside the hotel. (with a roof.) Our room was extremely noisy, we could hear other guests all night, and the maids startet at 09.00.. We didn't eat at the hotel, and it was clean and elegant, and that's pretty much the positive things that can be said.
