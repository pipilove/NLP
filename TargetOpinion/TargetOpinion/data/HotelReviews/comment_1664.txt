Terrible Service at the W Hotel!

I stayed at the W, Seattle in January 2007, and I have to say I was quite disappointed in the service. Firstly, I should say that it is a well designed hotel, so I definitely appreciated the ambiance, however, service was not very good. Upon entering our room, the toilet was dirty! When we complained about it, they did offer to switch our room, which was a nuisance since I literally unpacked everything! But they promised it would be an upgrade. To our dismay, the only difference with the new room was that it had a built-in bench by the window instead of two chairs. The other problem was that we asked for hot water to make baby formula. They told me I had to pay $6 for that... to make baby formula! I couldn't believe what a rip-off that was. Unfortunately, it was late in the evening, so I just paid the ridiculous price. I would have just boiled hot water in the coffee maker if they had a coffee maker like their room booklet said they should have, but of course, after having opened for 8 months, they said they still were ironing out the kinks. The one positive thing is that I complained about this issue the next day, and they did reimburse us for the water, but if first impressions are important for a classy hotel chain such as the W, I can't say that I was very impressed at all.
