It was... average.

The front desk staff was very helpful they even got us a rate lower than what the website quoted ($210 vs. 245). they were very accomodating by letting us check-in late at midnite after our long drive from LA. we ordered room service and they were out of almost everything. so we picked what was left: a mediocre sandwiich and cheese plate. the room service took forever, we were informed they were understaffed that night (odd for a friday night).our bathroom lights had a flickering problem, but the room was pretty spacious. the decor our our standard was a letdown compared to the extravagance of the lobby. i was also dissappointed with the sheets, they were a little rough. i expected more for the prices they charge but you can't beat their location!
