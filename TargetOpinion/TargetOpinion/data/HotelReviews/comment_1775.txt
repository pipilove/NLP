Don't expect much and you won't be dissapointed

I have to agree with a couple of the recent posts in that we booked this hotel based on numerous good reviews and a good price compared to anything downtown. The two major problems was that our room did not have air conditioning and the bed was just awful. We settled in too late the first night to realize that our room did not have a/c and didnt realize that a small portion of the rooms do (it isn't advertised at the hotel). It wasnt terribly warm in Seattle, but it was stuffy in the room and sleeping with the windows open is great until 6 am when the trucks begin to drive up and down the surrounding streets.We knew going in we would only have a queen bed, but the mattress and pillows were not comfortable at all.We had no problems with the staff or the cleanliness of the place and thought the location was great. In an old neighborhood with a few local bars/restaurants where you could avoid the downtown crush and a 10 - 15 minute walk to the Space Needle/Monorail etc.If you do stay here, request a room with a/c to allow you to keep your windows closed in the morning, unless your plans are to get up first thing in the morning.
