Go elsewhere

After reading some of the reviews here, I felt I had a good idea on what to expect. First, the rooms are definitely small. Crazy small. Bathroom barely fits the sink and toilet and then there is another room for the shower (some rooms have diff. configurations, but all bathrooms are split up). Basically the room is a bed and long desk with a flat screen tv propped on it. However, everyone here talks about how great the customer service is, but I had the opposite experience. We got in late after driving for 5 hours from Whistler. Once we got there, the night manager checked us in. She didn't ask if we needed help with our bags or anything. So we grabbed their luggage carts ourselves (no idea where the bellperson was at this point) and loaded the cars ourselves. Then we got to the elevator. Basically, in order to get these luggage carts into the elevator, you need a degree in Geometry. So we're dead tired, trying to get the luggage carts into the elevator, and the night manager is just standing there talking with the valet guy or possibly the bellperson. Nobody even offers to help or do anything to help us. They just let us struggle. Unreal! I'm not sure where the customer service comments come from, but we definitely did not see anything remotely resembling customer service. Do not stay here. The Roosevelt (where we stayed before departing for Whistler) down the street is cheaper and ten times better.
