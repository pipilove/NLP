Great Staff, Rooms, buffet breakfast and Location

I regularly travel for business and pleasure and have also worked in a top luxury hotel. The staff at the Mecure provided excellent, friendly service that is definitely top notch. Rooms and hotel are very clean and breakfast buffet great variety and staff very quick to keep it stocked and very tidy. The atmosphere was inviting in every way; have only positive things to say about my 4 day stay. Definitely recommended. Very central location.
