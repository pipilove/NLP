Much Better than Expected

My husband and I stayed at this hotel in mid August. I was pleasantly surprised. This is a 2 star hotel? It is nicer than 3 star hotels I stayed in previously. The room was beautiful. We got a room with a view of the canal. Beautiful bathroom. The lobby is exquisite. Having all day access to a hot drink and a cookie or a fruit. Really nice touch. A quick walk from DAM Square and then all the other action. The staff was great. My advice... don't stay anywhere else - this is truly great value for the money.
