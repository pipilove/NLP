Ok business hotel - not bad, but you can do better

Having seen how highly this hotel scores on Trip Advisor, I'm left feeling that some other reviewers could have a career as wine critics. ;-)I travel a lot and stay in a lot of business hotels around Asia. This hotel doesn't cut it as a 5 star hotel. It perhaps just scrapes through as a 4 star, but more realistically, it's a 3 and a half. There is nothing dramatic to fault, it's just old and tired and the service is hit  miss.Yes, the rooms are clean, and if you are lucky you get a good view of the harbour  the opera house (but you would also get this at any of the many high-rise hotels at this end of town). And yes, the location is good if you are a tourist or if you work at the north end of the CBD (otherwise only average). There is an Avis desk with available cars at the hotel, which is very convenient. BUT, the bathroom is small, basic and dated. A minimal update some time recently didn't really disguise this. The air conditioning is noisy, and still has a not-very-accurate dial on the wall as it's controller. The furniture  fixtures show plenty of signs of a tough life.No doubt, if you stay here, you will be comfortable enough, but don't expect 5 star standard. And for this money, there are better options.
