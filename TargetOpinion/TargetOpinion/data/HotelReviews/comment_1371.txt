would not recommend it

I am not a hotel snob - I don't mind a little noise, a little bit of dirt, etc. , but given the fairly strong review for this place, I was very disappointed.First, from day one our bathroom had a urine smell that never went away. Otherwise the bathroom was decent enough - decent temperature and decent water pressure.The room was loud loud loud. We were on the fourth floor and could literally hear conversations on the street, with our windows shut. The ac did not seem very accurate or effective and do not book a room with a sleeper sofa. Don't get me going on the noise the fridge made - it sounded like a jet plane every time the motor shifted. I finally had to buy sleeping pill across the street to try to sleep through all of this.Then my last morning, I got to hear a heated argument between the reception desk and the police. The police were investigating something that had happened and staff would not cooperate so the police got very annoyed...all this in front of guest.On a positive note, we did like having a Trader Joe's right behind the hotel and used the mini bar to store our goods.l also enjoyed the morning coffee in the lobby and the free wine. But not enough to every bring me back here.
