Great little hotel

We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights following a short cruise which ended in barcelona. The hotel was easy to find, maybe 5 mins walk from the top end of the Ramblas. The hotel is very modern and fairly minimalistic in decor. The staff were English speaking and friendly. Although we arrived at 9.30am, they had a room for us by 10am. The room was spacious, good king size bed and blackout curtains. There is a great (small) pool on the roof terrace with views around barcelona and it was empty on the first day. By the second day the pool area was busy, but there were still seats/loungers. We got a late checkout no problem. We didnt try the room service/bar, but the maid service was accomodating with the time the room was made up. I would highly recommend this hotel. Despite being a 3*, it has all we typically find in a 4*.
