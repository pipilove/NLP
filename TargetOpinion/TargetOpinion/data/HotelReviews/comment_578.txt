Great Hotel for Central Barcelona

After trawling this site and others, we went for this hotel for a short weekend trip to Barcelona. We went there on route to a friend's wedding so I was looking for somewhere central that would give us access to all the main tourist spots.The hotel is ideally located at the top of the Ramblas right opposite the beginning of the Gothic quarter.I found the staff to be very helpful and friendly. The room was small but really clean  contemporary in design. We overlooked the middle courtyard which was great for us as it meant we weren't disturbed by the noise on the Ramblas.The breakfast is fantastic if a little expensive (you're looking at around æ‹¢15 for it). So, either make sure you give youself plenty of time to graze or head out to one of the coffee bars in the area to grab a coffee  pastry.The highlight of the hotel really for me was the rooftop pool - very peaceful and relaxing after a day's sightseeing.I would definitely recommend this hotel as a very good mid range option.
