Did not like management

I stayed at the mediterranean inn couple of times and did some monthly stays.There were problems: 1) Although most of the staff is welcoming and nice to the guest - the management is not.Jim Farley - the frontdesk manager expects the person to do the housekeeper job (all crumbs have to be removed, trash removed etc). Maybe the reason is that housekeeping does an average job when they clean?And if you sleep in longer and housekeeper cannot enter the room - the front desk manager will be angry at you and believe me - he can display this.Anger is something that the front desk manager can show and can make your stay unpleasant.The rooms have internet access. If you happen to have a virus in your computer and it affects the network then you will likely be disconnected permanently and you will never be able to use internet in your room in future visits. The network is setup that if one computer has a virus then all of the network can go down.So in essence I felt that the management gives you a privelage to stay and not the other way round. The management tends to be rude and impolite.2) Although the hotel has underground parking, high speed internet, and is located in the heart of nice district in Seattle - rooms are small.3) I have noticed that little maintainence is done here. The rooms are acquiring more and more scratches, stains etc. They still look respectable at the time of the review.
