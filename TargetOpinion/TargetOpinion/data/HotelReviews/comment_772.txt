Good location, poor hotel.

Stayed in Hotel Am Zoo for 2 nights at end of Jan '07. First impressions were good, location right at heart of the city, close to bars, restaurants and transport links.Unfortunately, the good first impressions were gone very quickly! We had ordered a double room, but were given a room with 2 single beds which couldn't be changed as hotel was full. Staff were completely unhelpful and treated our request for a room change in line with our booking with a shurg of the shoulders!Room we had was cold and very noisy due to closeness of railway. Hotel overall has seen better days and is in need of refurbishment.Breakfast was good and served til 11am at weekends.Overall, I would see this as a fairly good 3star hotel but quite far short of the four star we had been expecting.
