Impossibly small room for two people

Beware that the so-called standard room is so tiny, two people need to take turns walking around the room. The hotel claim that this is a standard room for two is based upon the size of the bed which nearly fills the space of the room. Berlin Plaza has no air conditioning and windows open only part way. On the plus side, hotel does have a GREAT location and is clean.
