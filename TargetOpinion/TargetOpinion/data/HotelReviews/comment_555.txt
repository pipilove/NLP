Hotel Jazz has it all

Hotel Jazz had it all- great location, decor, price, comforts. It's in a great central neighborhood in walking distance to all kinds of restaurants, museums, shops and the subway station is less than a block away. Beautiful and comfortable inside, expecially the bathroom. Sleek and sophiticated. This place gave us the perfect rest from busy Barcelona. Definitely worth the affordable price.
