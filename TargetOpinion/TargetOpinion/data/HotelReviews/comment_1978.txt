Good experience at the Rad

Stayed here for one night on our way through to New Zealand. I've been before and as with my previous stay everything was exceptional from the furnishings of the room to the customer service. Location is perfect for seeing sydney being 5 mins from circular key and 5 mins in the opposite direction to the center of Sydney's shopping. The bed was particularly of note - the best we slept in whilst away (we both agreed on this).The only thing you won't get here is any form of view from the window, other than that this is great place to stay and excellent value for money.
