we booked a comfort room for 4 nights,at this hotel, from internet.we asked a room with view at upper levels.they gave us a large and luxuriousroom at 6th floor with great view, as we asked....the breakfast was the better i ever seen,with free champagne every day. you can take there mas cart,so you will pay 30 euros for 2 persons.do it anyway !!!! there are many bars and restaurants just in the other side of the river.try them.at bar called vang gogh the owner play piano.....try the dada falafel at oranien str, and cafe einstein.in a few words,melia hotel was fantastic !!
