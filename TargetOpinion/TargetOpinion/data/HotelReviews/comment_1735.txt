It's truly GRAND!

We stayed at the Grand Hyatt Seattle for six wonderful nights at the end of June. This is one of the BEST hotels I've ever enjoyed! We upgraded to a Regency Club room and were given a corner room on the 20th floor. Great view! We loved the layout. As you enter the room, there's a small living area with a couch/chair/desk/TV. Turn down a small hallway to reach the bathroom and bed. Oh the bed! It was so comfortable! What a great way to end the busy day...just sinking into it and surrounding yourself with the many pillows.Speaking of beds...we requested a rollway for my young daughter. It was already in the room waiting for us. That's a first! I always have to call for it wherever we stay. The Regency Club is worth the extra money. They serve a nice continental breakfast complete with fresh fruit, juices and cereals. In the evening, there's always a cheese selection, veggies and a hot appetizer. For a small charge ($4 I think), you can enjoy good Washington state wines and beers. Plus, free Internet access. We saved so much money by paying a little extra per night. Holly, the Regency Club conceige, heard that we were celebrating our daughter's third birthday during our visit. Holly wrote a special Birthday note along with a special cookie with a candle and presents (rubber duck and a beach ball). It was a true act of kindness on her part.Everyone from the valets and the front desk folks to the Regency Club staff is very friendly and helpful. Housekeeping was top notch. Each day the room was spotless. Each night our beds were turned down and ice brought to the room. We were treated like royality. There's no place else to stay while in Seattle!
