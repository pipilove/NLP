reserve in advance and stay for 5 days!

Imagine that you want to make reservations for 3 nights in a hotel and you check availablity 4 months ahead. The hotel tells you that bookings can only be made 2 months in advance, so you go back 2 months before your scheduled arrival date. Quess what? Fully booked!! Oh yeah they forgot to tell that bookings in excess of 4 days can be made anytime of the year... How would you feel? The hotel where this happened? Right: The seven bridge hotel.
