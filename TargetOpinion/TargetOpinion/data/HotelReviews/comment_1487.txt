Nice hotel, fantastic place, expansive parking

We stayed at St. Francis for 5 nights. We booked the hotel in Europe and the price is really okay if you book it at a traveller office in Europe and not online on there homepage. You get much cheaper rates.The hotel is directly on the union square. It is easy to go to fishermans warf with the cable car, to walk to china town, italian town or coit tower. Or simply go shopping to market street.The room is a little bit small if you want to have only one bed for two. The bathroom was old and not that nice. It does not fit to the rest of the room.We were for 3 weeks in the USA and San Francisco was our last stop. We had a rental car and the bigest problem at the St. Francis for me was the expansive parking garage. I think a hotel like the St. Francis should have a parking garage for free for there guests. The garage for one day with in and out costs 44 Dollars. Anyway the parking in San Fran is expansive but at the St. Francis its much more expansive. So if you ever come by car to the St. Francis: Park at the Sutter-Stockten Garage. It's only a 3 minutes walk from the St. Francis and has cheaper rates.
