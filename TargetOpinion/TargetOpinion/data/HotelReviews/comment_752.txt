good value for the money

Stay there for five nights. The hotel is located on a main noisy road but in a nice and elegant neighbourhood. There are lot of cosy and smart restaurants and cafe in the vicinity - lots of dining options. The staff are very nice and helpful. The room is very basic, large enough and clean, but a bit cold and not so intimate. We check one hour before offical check-in time and they charged us for an extra 5 euro for it!!! - we checked out 4 hours before time and didn't get credit for that.... As previous reviewer has noticed, the airconditioner didn't work and the room was too hot at night. We asked the reception to solve the problem but they didn't take care of it!If you want to stay on the west side of the city and not to spend lots of money - it's a good choice. If you expect to stay in a place more characteristic - stay away.
