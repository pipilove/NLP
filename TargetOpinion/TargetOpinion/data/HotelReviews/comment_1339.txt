A Very Pleasant Surprise

We have all seen the nice staged pictures of hotels online - and more times than not, they do not measure up. However, the Argonaut was EXACTLY like the pictures and description and more. The rooms were larger than SF standard. The beds, linen, cleanliness were impeccable. Having a second window would have been nice. The rooms were quiet. The wine hour was delightful. Location was convienent - and not in the throes of the typical 'Fisheman's wharf' tshirt shops etc. A classy, comfort, pleasant hotel. The concierge department could use some assistance..but they can at least guide you if you new to the area.
