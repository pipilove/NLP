Pray it's not warm!

Yes, the location is great. Yes, the place is trendy. Our suite (for which read large room) was also very spacious, clean and comfortable. The buffet breakfast is excellent. But, boy, do they have a real problem with the A/C - just as other summer reviewers have pointed out. My complaint is not that the system only cools to 21 degrees - this would not be an issue in the slightest if, in fact, it were actually capable of cooling to anything approaching this temperature in summer. The simple fact is that it isn't, and this detracted hugely from my enjoyment of the property. To make matters worse, the staff are clearly trained to deny that there is an issue, instead implying that it is unreasonable for guests to expect the system to work any better than it does. Moevenpick management - I suggest you read the sheer volume of comments here and draw your own conclusions. Until you do, this will remain a quirky, interesting, well-located but fundamentally flawed hotel. (P.S. While you're at it, you might consider investing in a gym worthy of the premises - or, if you believe that just one treadmill is sufficient for a large hotel, please at least ensure that it functions!)
