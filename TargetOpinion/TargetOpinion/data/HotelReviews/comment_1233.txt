Good Experience

We stayed at the Chancellor over the christmas holidays in dec '04. It was a very good experience - the hotel is charming, the staff is helpful and nice. The only complaint is that there was only one elevator working...so i would check to see if the second elevator is working before making a reservation on one of the higher floors. The location was amazing - we had never been to san fran before and the cable car ride to the wharf was right across the street. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone that was traveling to san francisco (and especially if they're looking to shop!).
