Nice but expensive

We booked a double room at this hotel with airmiles and our friends booked a junior suite. Our room was on the fifth floor and had a wonderful view of Paris and the Eiffel Tower. However, I was a bit disappointed with it, the decor was predominately red and could have been any airport hotel and the bathroom was very small and you had to stand in the bath to turn the taps on. The hotel is on a busy corner and I did think it might be noisy but I didn't hear traffic noise at night only the noise of the TV in the next bedroom. Our friends had a much nicer room but they had paid a lot more for it. Our deal included breakfast which was nice. We ate on the top floor terrace one night and it was quite good and a fantastic view but again very expensive for simple French food which you could get for half the price down the road at any local restaurant.The service was excellent and they went to great trouble for us.
