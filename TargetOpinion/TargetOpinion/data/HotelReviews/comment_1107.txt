A good hotel for 2007

When we booked I made a point of asking if there would be any renovation work going on at the time of our stay. The reception staff said that there would be a little, but there would be no noise audible in our room. It was very disappointing to find that during the day a loud drilling noise which vibrated through the building could often be heard. Having stayed here several times before, the whole point of this hotel is the great rooms which provide an escape from the chaos outside. Until the work is complete we won't be returning, and even then it bothers me that they were less than honest when we booked. The work was due to end this summer (June 2006), but it now looks likely to continue for some months beyond that. Once the work is complete I would certainly recommend this hotel again, as I agreeËÅΩwith most of the comments written below.
