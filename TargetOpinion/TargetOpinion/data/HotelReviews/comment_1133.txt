WORST HOTEL SERVICE EVER!

I have stayed at this hotel for 2 days in June 2008. The hotel is nice, claiming to be luxury, whereas the only luxury it provides is its excellent location. Other than that, it lacks service. I wanted to make a reservation at the hotel's restaurant. I called the restaurant from my room, nobody answered, I called the concierge, none answering, finally I called the reception, which transferred me to the concierge again, which made me wait for half an hour, when I personally had to go to the desk because the concierge stopped picking up the phone. At the desk, the lady was extremely rude, still telling me to wait, because she was busy. No apologies. If this hotel claims to be a luxury hotel, the service should be a reflection of that. I have stayed at many hotels, but this one tops in LACK OF SERVICE.
