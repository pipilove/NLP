Nice Hotel....not a 5 Star one though!!

Having stayed at this hotel last July for a friend's hen weekend I knew it was a lovely hotel and for a 5*, good value, especially with the location. I re-booked it for this May for a friend's 30th and was disapointed that the prices had gone up by over æ‹¢50 each PER NIGHT despite only being early May but felt it was worth it as we had used the facilities last year and it was superb. However, we were extremely disapointed to discover that the swimming pool was empty and were told this was because it wasn't summer yet despite the temperatures being 29 degrees????!!!! Also, the rooms were not as good as they were the previous years and I just felt that overall, this was not acceptable for a far from cheap 5* hotel. I won't be staying there again which is a real shame.
