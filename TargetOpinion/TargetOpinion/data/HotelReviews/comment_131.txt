good for the price

Stayed for the nights for a total of 300e prepaid, good value at this price.Location easy. Receptionist polite although under great pressure as hotel was full. Didnt eat in hotel. Room in wing needed sprucing up but other wise fine. Quiet for Amsterdam. Some of the common areas in the wing need sprucing up too.Pool not a common facility in Amsterdam.Stayed here before and will again but depends on price here and elsewhere.
