Good, but something... was... hmmm....

I have to admit, I had a great rate for my stay at the Omni and I wonder if that is the reason for my experience. Great front desk staff, maid service was good, but my room... I walked in the room and the first thing I noticed were stains on the carpet. Normally, this doesn't bother me at all, so I ignored them. Then I noticed another larger stain in front of my window, as if someone had spilled something and it settled into the carpet. Again, I ignored it, thinking I was just being picky. Later that night, I tripped a little bit on a piece of carpet that had been pulled up as I was walking into the bathroom. I know this sounds silly, but by this time I was thinking... what is going on here? I would come back to stay at the Omni, but I have a feeling that it will need some upgrades to the rooms, soon.
