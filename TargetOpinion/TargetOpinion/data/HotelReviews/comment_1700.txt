Not so great at all!

Initially the hotel looked nice from outside. The lobby was a lot smaller than we had thought from the photographs and it was all looking a little shabby. I was immediately put off by the unproffesional manner the front desk staff seemed to have. As we went into the lift a staff maintence worker came out of the lift, i dont mean to sound rude but the lift was small enough and surely it should be just for guests! When we got to the room we were a little dissapointed at how small the bathroom was honestly it was the smallest bathroom I have ever seen in my life thankgod we are slim people! When we got home one evening we noticed that the bed sheets looked unwashed we found hairs all over the sheets. We asked for them to be changed and they were but to be honest the new sheets didnt look or smell much cleaner.One evening we were stood waiting for the lift we waited and waited and still nothing! We asked if there were any stairs we could use as most hotels do have a set, we were then escorted through the unbelievably messy and horrible looking back office! I have never in my life had to do that in any hotel! All in all we really weren't impressed there are plenty of other nice hotels in the city so avoid this one!
