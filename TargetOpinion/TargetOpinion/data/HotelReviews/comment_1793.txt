Great Value, Great Location, Great View

Just got back from Seattle and we stayed here for 4 nights. I rate this place highly because it is cheap, clean, all of the rooms have kitchenettes and it is in a great location. My wife and I stayed here with our baby and this place was great for us. The room was big enough for a travel crib. (Room 411) It was quiet. And best of all there are two grocery stores very close to the hotel to buy food from and avoid overpriced, crowded restaurants. (no fun with a baby) The Metropolitan Store has tons of great food that is ready to eat. Safeway is kind of a dump. The hotel is also less than a block away from the bus stop that will take you right to Pike Market and Pioneer Square. Let's face it, this isn't the Four Seasons. If you want that you have to pay for it. If you want to extend your stay by spending less on hotels, food, parking your car, and getting around....stay here. ps: the roof top view is almost as good as the Space Needle.
