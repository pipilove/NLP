Loved it as usual...will be going back in June.

While my husband and I live in Marin County, which is only 25 minutes away from The Orchard Hotel in San Francisco, we love going there for the weekend. When we do several times a year we always stay at the Orchard Hotel on Bush and Powell Streets. We were just there last weekend (May 24 and 25th) to celebrate my birthday...and as usual the hospitality was A+. We also love the decor and the location -- we are a block from China Town. Would highly recommend this hotel for out of towners or locals like ourselves.
