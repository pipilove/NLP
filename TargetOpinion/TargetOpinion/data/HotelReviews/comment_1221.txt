Reminds me of a sultry dorm room

I only stayed here for one night as a vacation day before a business trip. Since my company wasn't paying for the hotel on my day off, I choose to use a discount hotel website that doesn't tell you the name of the hotel before booking. Basically, it is a place to sleep that is indoors. I'm 6'5 and the bed is 5'10. The TV is the exact version my 87 year old grandpa has, except smaller. On a bright note, they had free cookies at the front desk - on a sad note, they were not good. The bathroom is clean, which is always a good thing. The room itself is very small - it reminds me of my dorm room from college, except with uglier carpet. That's about all.
