Nice hotel, poor service

This hotel is in a great location and the rooms are wonderful, but everything is spoilt by the attitude of many staff. On my first night, I had just arrived from overseas and needed a good sleep. However, there was a function being held below my room and the loud noise continued until well after midnight. When I rung Reception to complain, I was basically told too bad. I later spoke to security staff who had the same attitude. Obviously, the noisy function area had precedence over guests' peace  quiet.  I must say however, that after writing a letter of complaint, I was actually contacted by the Manager who promised to compensate me. He did eventually, after I reminded him of his promise! I would stay there again, but ask for a quiet room.
