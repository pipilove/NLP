A must for the Seattle experience

My stay at the Andra was exceptional. The location was terrific. Within walking distance of Pike Street, Needle, Jazz Clubs, Fine Restruants, and just plain city kicking around. The rooms were clean and well maintained. The staff was the best. The beds were unreal. If I didnt want to go out and see the city so much I would have just layed about in them all day they were that comfortable. My wife and myself were so impressed that we have swore to return for a long weekend. For those who are taking a cruise out of Seattle , like us, plan an extra day or two prior to your leaving and stay at the Andra (about 3 minutes form the debarkation dock) to compliment your trip. You will not be dissapointed.
