Over-rated Definitely over-rated.

The only good thing about it is the location although the small pool area is next to a busy road and railway line which is not conducive to relaxation. The rooms were small and our TV did not work and had to be repaired. There were very limited TV channels. The room we were initially allocated reeked of tobacco smoke and it took a while to get relocated.We repeatedly had to ask for toiletries to be replaced.Over-pretentious and not good value for money. Obviously reliant on its name and location.Would not cfhoose to stay there again!
