Keeping it Old School at the Modern Intercontinental

At $114 for each of three summer weeknights, I was really satisfied with the Intercontinental. I booked about a month in advance on their website. As stated in other reviews, the location is on the (slightly tourist) bus line 200 and a 5 minute walk to Ku'damm, and 10 minutes to the Zoo Garten Train station. Note, it was a 15-20 minute walk to a cheap internet cafe (open till eleven-thirty) attached to a dunkin donuts on Ku'damm. This was a decent vantage point and was obviously a safe and quiet neighborhood. Fast food restaurants are opposite the Gedaechtnis Kirche if you are absolutely desperare for cheap fare late at night. The rooms themselves are very modern, but almost frustratingly so. The bathroom door has a hole for a handle, and the toilet door is opaque. So, no real sense of firm privacy is established. The shower also had no curtain, but rather a limited glass door. So it was kind of easy to accidentally spill some water on the floor (not to mention slip and break your neck). Still the design was cool and memorable. The breakast buffet was too expensive for our liking, however, our guide book had a listing of six special places for breakfast in Berlin. What also bothered me was the fact there was a 3 euro surcharge for dialing a 800 number (so to use a phone card, you had to go to the Telefonzelle across the street. The pool was mid-seized but adequate and clean. The whirlpool was out of this world. On weeknights we had the facilitiies practically all to ourselves. Plus they are open to 11, perfect after a long day and big dinner. The staff was friendly and completely bilingual. Be sure to pick up an umbrella (for free) at the concierge if you anticipate rain while sightseeing. Alltogether I enjoyed my stay and would book again at anything below $120 a night.
