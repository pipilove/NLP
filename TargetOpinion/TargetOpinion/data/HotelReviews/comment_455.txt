Great hotel but not without it's (bad) surprises

Having stayed in Barcelona a number of times decided to treat myself to the Grand Marina - brilliant location, brilliant views over the harbour/Mare Magnum and good sized rooms with equally good sized and well equipped bathroom.All was well until 1.30am when a ferry proceeded to moor outside the window of my room and then leave it's engine running all night (and through to 17:00 the next day when I left).No amount of double glazing was going to stop the noise but on a 5* hotel I'd expect at least a warning to be prepared for noise.Not surprisingly no response to a complaint (both in person at departure and in writing) hence time to make others aware so that they book well aware of potential issues.
