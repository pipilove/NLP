Great - but 1 Major problem

Beautiful hotel on one of the best shopping streets. I booked throughthe hotels website and choose a Superior room. Staff we really helpful and kind.Now for the problem - our Queen size bed was actually 2 single beds, although the website does say queen size or twin beds when you pay over 1000Euro for a 3 night stay (room only) you dont expect to wake up on the floor after falling through the middle of them on the first night.
