like home for 3 weeks

Before my husband and I left Berlin which was home for us for 2,5 years, we stayed at the Swissotel for 3 weeks after moving out of our apartment (the furniture was on the ship back to the States). The staff said, we would probably kill each other after two weeks in a standard room, so they upgraded us to a suite without additional charge. Our room had a view over Kurfuerstendamm, which was really nice, although we had to have the windows closed basically all the time due to the traffic noise (but we wanted the view for our last three weeks in Berlin). The service was awesome, the staff is extremely friendly and professional. Everything was taken care of. It was super-clean, we loved the turndown service at night and the fresh fruit on the table. The breakfast buffet left nothing to be desired. When I mentioned my gluten intolerance they brought gluten-free bread for breakfast every single morning (did I mention NO additional charge..!?). We go back for vacation next spring and will stay at this hotel again. The location is perfect - close to bus, underground and train and in walking distance to every wonderful shop, restaurant, bar or department store on Ku'Damm.We highly recommend this hotel for both business and leisure.
