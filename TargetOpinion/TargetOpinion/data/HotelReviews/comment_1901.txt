Four Points, Average Points

Being close to the city center, the main clientele is business people although when I was here (19 Sept. 2006) there was big Japanese wedding.The recpetionist has a smile when you check in but I have a feeling that they are overworked; every time I passed by the area, there was always a line at recpetion. The bell service is good.Room is just large enough to enjoy it for reading with a beautiful view of the harbor. The rooms are noisy as the walls are not solid enough to block out the noise from your neighbor next door or several doors down. The bathroom is adequate with a tub and a shower.The lobby and the surrounding areas have nice comfortable chairs to use while you browse the internet wirelessly.The coffee shop at the lobby is always busy with people lining up for breakfast. The wait isn't too bad, though. At other times, there is almost always a table readily available.
