Ok stay....

Stayed here for a week. Contacted the hotel directly and was able to get free breakfast thrown into our package (normally 10 euros per person). The breakfast was just fine w/ us - bread, cheese, croissants, cereal, etc. We were very worried because we had heard the hotel would be undergoing renovations at this time, but all that was going on was the top floor was being painted. Room was an ok size - desk, king bed, closet and enough room to put our 2 suitcases.Pros: Quiet, friendly staff, decent breakfast, good proximity to Eiffel Tower and short walk to Ecole Militaire metro stopCons: Leaky a/c  leaky sink (they did fix these problems), toilet was running (even after they though they fixed it), bed was hard, only English TV was CNN international (not that we expected any more than that), not really any night time entertainment in this area
