expensive for what it is but great location

Graet loaction right round the corner from Circular Quay where you catch ferries to all the main attractions, wlaking distance from the shops, Opera House, Botanical Gardens, Observatory and The Rocks.Staff completely unhelpful - trying to establish what was open over Easter weekend was a nightmare and they gave incorrect information. Views were good from SOME rooms but don't be fooled that you will necessarily see the Op House or Bridge unless they explicitly say so in your booking form - make sure you have it in writing.Breakfast buffet was expensive A$25, but had everything you could want - fruit, hot food, pancakes, cereals, baked goods. Very comfortable beds and large bathroom.
