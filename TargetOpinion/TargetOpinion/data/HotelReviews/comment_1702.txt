BIG DISAPPONTMENT

This hotel may have had a facelift, added some flat panel televisions and used excellent products such as Aveda, however, it lacked space, attentive and informative employees and customer service.  I was looking for a nice, better-than-average hotel to stay in on Valentine's night. When I found the Hotel Max website, I liked the modern feel and the fact that it was different. It was fairly easy to book online, however as I will later complain, nothing was mentioned as to 'extra' charges.  I parked in the garage and took the back entrance. There were no signs to indicate a 'valet' entrance, When I arrived at the counter, the desk person called for the valet and we handled it from there. At no time was there any information regarding the valet service, parking or any charges to take place. When I arrived at my room, I was not thrilled with the space in the room. Or should I say, lack thereof. Good thing I an not claustrophobic! Bottom line, I was disappointed to begin with, but when I checked out the next day, I was livid. There was a charge for $44.00 on my bill for PARKING. I had a guest and assumed they would be able to park with the valet as well. Again, no one mentioned, that there would be a $22.00 charge for parking. Not to mention the $6.00 charge for two minute packages of snacks!  I have stayed in some 5-star hotels. The do not charge 'hidden' fees. They are up front with their charges and it is expected when guests check out.  I am a local. I have a business here. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone.
