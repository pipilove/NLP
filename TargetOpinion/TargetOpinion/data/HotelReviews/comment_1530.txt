Bad Choice!

I booked this hotel through Hot Wire and called immediately requesting a nonsmoking room, a king bed and a room away from the elevator/ice.The person I spoke to was pleasant and stated they could not guarantee these requests would be honored but would make a note on the reservation. At check-in, the person at the desk was very rude, said there were no special request noted on our reservation card andstated there were no king beds and because of the way the reservation was made we were stuck with 2 double beds. We were located directly accross from the elevator and ice! It was nonsmoking. There is no elevator from the parking garage to the hotel. The Warwick mats in the garage are filthy as are the stairwells. The part of the hotel that faces 4th smells of urine. The carpets in the registration and elevator area need cleaning. The upholstery and curtains in our room needed cleaning andpressing There was a sign in the bathroom about water conservation;however, the tub facet dripped continuously. The tub drain needsattention, the shower curtain has holes in it. There was no coffee maker in the room. The bedding did not fit the bed and we found ourselves sleeping directly on the mattress with bedding askew. Other staff were also unfriendly and short. The housekeeping staff was quite pleasant. I will NEVER stay at this hotel!
