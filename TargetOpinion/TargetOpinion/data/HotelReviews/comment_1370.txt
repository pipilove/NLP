such nice folks

After much research of hotels in which to stay in SF prior to a cruise, I finally decided on the Best Western Tuscan Inn near Fishermans wharf. It was nice, the folks there very helpful--letting us check in early without so much as a frown--polite and eager to help in any way. I would love to go back and stay again--this time a little longer. It's easy to catch a taxi to anywhere you want to go, and the bellman was very helpful. The beds were comfortable with nice down comforters. The food was good at the resteraunt also. A good place to start a cruise!!
