Loved the 1898

Stayed at the 1898 for a week for our wedding anniversary and loved it. We had a 'superior' room in the red and white colour scheme (331) which was immaculately clean and had plenty of room. Nice touches included the robes and slippers and the fact they always replaced the soap - maybe petty but I've stayed in some '5 star' places that expect you to use one tiny piece of soap for your whole stay. Plus toothbrush and shaving kits as standard in bathrooms - no having to ask reception if you'd forgotten something.The location is ideal for exploring Barcelona - I don't know how someone can describe the location as 'awful' - umm if you don't want to stay on La Rambla - then don't, but it's on a major tourist central road - I'm not sure what they expected . The room was lovely and quiet considering where it was located. We didn't eat in the hotel as it did seem a little expensive for what was on offer and there are plenty of cafes nearby - there's a Starbucks next door for those craving a caffeine fix and a number of small supermercados nearby for picking up water/drinks for cheaper than the mini bar. I will definitely stay at the 1898 for our next Barcelona trip - in fact I can't wait.
