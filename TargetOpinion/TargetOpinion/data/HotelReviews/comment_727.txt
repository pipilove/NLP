A bit of a monstrosity

This is not a bad place to stay, it's very near public transportation and has clean and spacious accomodations. The service staff at the front desk were very helpful. There were a few minor irritations, however. The bizarre shower in our room leaked all over the floor of the toilet and sink area. The television reception seemed to run off of antenna and was subpar. The bar/cafe in the lobby breezeway had free Internet if you were eating or drinking, but they didn't take credit cards or allow charges to the room. What the hell? Who doesn't take credit cards in a major European city in a major hotel anymore? The other complaint is just the sheer size of the hotel and the size of the groups the place attracts. It reminded me of the days of the Hotel Rossiya in Moscow. You'd see 4 tour buses pull up out front and all of the sudden the lobby would be full of 300 new check-ins and you'd have a devil of a time using the elevator or just walking out the door. Also, adjacent Alexanderplatz is undergoing massive construction that has fencing up all over the place. It really makes it a hassle to get in and out of the place.
