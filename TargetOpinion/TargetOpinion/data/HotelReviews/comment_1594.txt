Horrible Hotel!

Be careful with this hotel. They will cheat you. When I called to make a reservation for a government conference I was told the hotel was completely sold out. I requested to be put on a waiting list and they took my name. A few days later a co-worker called and was able to book a room and received the government rate. I called the hotel and asked why I wasn't called. They gave me the run around and said an opening came up. I asked if an an opening came up, why didn't they call me since I was on the waiting list. They agreed to give me a room (hmmm...thought they were sold out) but said they couldn't accomodate all the nights of my stay. But they would not give me the government rate even though they gave it to my co-worker who called AFTER I did. There is major construction going on at this hotel. In addition, the hotel is not very nice. They don't have a business center, gift shop, or wireless internet. They only have one place to eat and the prices are outrageous for very average food. Whatever you do, don't stay at this hotel. There are many other nice hotels who will accomodate their guests. The Seattle Sheraton has no sense of customer service. Avoid this hotel!
