We stayed here in July 04, and wow, you simply cannot ask for a better-placed Hotel, bang where it's happening! (on the infamous Ramblas). Bars/Restaurants a plenty, all within a stone's throw.We found the Hotel to be clean and tidy, with efficient, cooperative and friendly staff.The general quality of the rooms/hotel exceeded our expectations by far, given the rate we paid.The bedrooms are adequate in size, with AC, good size/quality clean Bathroom/WC, and a nice large walk in wardrobe with room safe, and Colour Sat TV. Tho some rooms don't necessarily have a view, so ask for one at the front of the building (but this will be noisier if you leave the windows open).Breakfast buffet is good; help yourself as much as you want.The Reception staff were SO accommodating, and helped us out as we'd (a party of 8 guys on a stag) inadvertently booked Doubles rather than Twins, so on arrival we asked if they could change our booking, they said they were fully booked and that it would be very difficult to do this, however, they pulled out all the stops for us and within the hour had changed our rooms so that we all had beds to ourselves!I would thoroughly recommend staying at this hotel, and would undoubtedly stay again when visiting Barca.Not going to mention much about the Ramblas that hasn't been said before, except to say, yup, believe the hype! It's a great place for young, old, single and couples, however put on your streetwise hat, because there are hustlers working the Ramblas and you could easily fall prey to pickpockets, 'street magic' hustlers and also, (late at night) the ladies of the night, so BEWARE!!
