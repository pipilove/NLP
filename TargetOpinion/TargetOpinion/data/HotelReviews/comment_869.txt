Awful Experience

This was supposed to me the first stop on a 3-leg European trip. As soon as I arrived I knew things were not going to go as planned. The front desk person informed me that there would be no towel or maid service and after checking into the room, I noticed there was no airconditioning--making the room unbearibly hot. There were also mildew stains on the uncomfortable concrete tub and the room was anything but warm and inviting. This place is a joke--I can't imagine anyone finding it alluring. The staff is unprofessional and unfriendly--the place has the charm of a prison. Within 5 minutes, I asked to check out. The front desk person pleaded with me to stay, but leaving was one of the smartest decisions I've ever made. Checked into the Westin--stayed in one of their brand new spa suites--and had one of the best stays of my life.
