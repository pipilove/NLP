Good location

Nice hotel with good location near the shopping area, subway station, Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church etc. Rooms are quite small, but clean and modern. Plenty of TV channels in many languages.Nice breakfast, although the breakfast room is quite crowded. They had on some days another breakfast room opened on another floor.They were kind enough to allow us an early check-in. Polite staff.
