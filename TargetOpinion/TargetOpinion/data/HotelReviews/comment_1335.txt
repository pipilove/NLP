Unpleasant experience.

We had a problem with our hotel stay. The night clerk mistakenly telephoned our room at 5:30 a.m. on a Saturday morning. He was looking for the room that had ordered a car. We were on vacation and had hoped to sleep until at least 8:00 a.m. Neither of us were able to go back to sleep because of the noise from the courtyard below and because of the noise from the housekeeping staff. The housekeeping staff was very loud in the mornings. They knock loudly on each door and laugh and joke in the hallway as early as 7:00 a.m. This is okay if you are a business traveler. We were on a romantic getaway. This is not the place to stay if you are on a romatice getaway.
