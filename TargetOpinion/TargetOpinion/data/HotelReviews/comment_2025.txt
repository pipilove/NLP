Fantastic Location

Booked this hotel through Quantas holidays and it was fantastic, the rooms were clean and spacious and the staff friendly and polite. The hotel itself is on a main road but the rear view rooms faced a quieter street. The hotel is literally less than 5 minutes walk from circular quays which is where you have access to all the ferries that take you round the harbour. It is near to hundreds of shops and restaurants and the nearest tube station is over the road, really was a great base to explore the city.
