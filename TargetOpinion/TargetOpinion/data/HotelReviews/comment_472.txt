If you want a good nights sleep do not stay here

This is not a 5 star hotel more like a 4 star. The staff are brilliant but the building though reasonably new is starting to fall appart through neglect.Check-in was fine as were all the staff encountered but the room was below 3 star as to maintenance. All facilities were there LCD tv, mini-bar, power shower, whirlpool bath the list goes on.But the maintenance of these was none existant.Cheap laminate flooring was starting to lift leaving sharp edges to catch your feet on, the shower door failed to close as it was coming away from the wall so massive amounts of water covered the bathroom (remember it is a power shower).The Patio doors on the minute balcony refused to close or lock.The noise from the cruise liner outside our room until the early hours precluded any sleep, not that that was possible as the mattress and the pillow appeared to be made of some stone substitute. Even with the pillow menu a restful night was impossible.The general air of the hotel, as with the World Trade Centre complex is a little unloved which concidering its age is surprising.I could not in fairness not recommend the hotel, I may just have been unlucky, but for the money any other hotel in Barcelona would be better value. The possition of the hotel is great, near the city but not too near, easy level walks to all sites. Tourist bus stop outside the door and the ever attentive staff are all plus points. But oh the bed and the noise! And the appearant lack of any maintenance in room 751.Not recommended to people with a back, good hearing or thoughs who wish to wash beyond that it is a very nice expencive and convenient hotel in which to stay.We had booked three nights but checked out after the first..
