Good Business Hotel

Location is excellent if you are on business and your office is nearby (such as in my case) and it is reasonable convenient to the Opera House, the rocks and shopping in central sydney.Staff are overall very friendly, always greet you when you arrive by taxi, open the doors when walking into the lobby etc.Rooms are good but not very spacious. No views.Dry Cleaning is poor. I had a pair of cotton pants washed and the laundry/pressing was so poor that I had to redo it. Shirts were not done particulary well either.A good value hotel, but not particulary memorable.
