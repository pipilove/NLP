A little too clubby for me

I have never stayed at a W before, I have had many a martini at the San Francisco W but never stayed over night. The W Seattle is not as impressive as the San Francisco location. The lobby of the hotel is chopped into two different sections, reception and the living room lounge area. The reception is where you first enter and leaves a lot to be desired. Check in went smooth except that they stuck us in a room that looked out on to a parking garage (we asked for a nice view because it was my husbands birthday). Once we were switched we were fine with our room (even though no assistance was offered to move our luggage).The main problem that I had with this hotel is that I felt that it was trying to be so hard to be cool and hip that they over did it. I mean who really wants to walk into a blue dimly lit hallway at 10am or listen to house music in the restroom when you are heading out to breakfast. There is a time and place for these things and the morning did not feel like that time.Another strange thing that happened during our stay is that 20-30 young people were staying at the hotel (in their teens) and all the hallways reeked of pot. One day they camped out in the lobby and were sprawled across the couches and by the fire drawing pictures, reading magazines and on the floor taking naps for hours. No other guests could access any part of this area during this time.Although we got a great deal and the hotel was in very easy walking distance to everything, I would probably opt to stay at one of the many other hotels in the surrounding area.
