Good as long as you don't pay the full price

I had never been to the Swiss hotel in berlin, so decided to give it a go.It is as clean as you expect a 4/5 star hotel to be.Staff was very good, but that has always been my experience in Germany.The rooms were quiet and well appointed, although not particuarly luxurious. The bathroom was small.The spa was clean and well provided for, although the gym was more of a corridor with a few machines threwn in than a suitable exercising place.I am afraid the the KuDam has never been my favourite place in Berlin, so the location was not what I would see as the hotel strong point. There is a strong feeling that the center of Berlin is now shifting back towards unter den Linden, and I would recommend to anyone travelling to Berlin to look for a hotel in that area, and avoid at all costs the dreadfully commercial and dull area around the Zoologisher station.In short, I would not stay there again, but would rather look for something less corporate, closer to Unter den Linden. At any rate I would not stay there unless paying only 50% of the listed price. There are plenty of offers on the net for that hotel
