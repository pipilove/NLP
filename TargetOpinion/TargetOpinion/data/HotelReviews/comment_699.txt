Not very clean

I have just returned from a five night stay in the hotel. Arrived early and left my luggage at reception. They do have a room for storing luggage and this is where my case was kept.The room itself was ok but the area around the bath had mold growing on it. I pointed this out to both the reception and the cleaning staff. Nothing happened. On the third day I tackled them again about the problem . Explanation given was the cleaning staff are Chinese and do not speak either English or German so they could not guarantee the problem could be resolved.I insisted on changing rooms and was eventually given a room on the executive floor.That room was much larger but with worn and dirty carpet.The breakfast buffet is adequate .The internet access is like a small telephone box with no seat.Location is quiet but the U bahn station is not on a main line and you have to change trains twice to get to Zoo Station which has connections to most places and the 100  200 buses stop there. It is 20 minutes walk to the hotel from there or 5 minutes by cab. Cost 5euro. Hasir restaurant on the corner of the street is very good.
