Great location, inconsistent service

I booked this Sheraton hotel in downtown Seattle via Hotwire for two nights. Arrived at the hotel at around 11:30am and asked for early check-in. The front desk staff was nice. Upon seeing my SPG Gold membership card, she checked me in, even though technically Hotwire bookings do not qualify for SPG Gold benefits.The room and amenities are what you would normally expect from a 4-star Sheraton. The best thing about this hotel is its location. It's just a few blocks walk to the Pike Place market, the water front. Monorail station is just 2 blocks away. Plenty of shopping and restaurant nearby.I usually leave a decent tip everyday with a Thank you note in the room for the maid when I stay in a hotel. This is on one hand customary, on the other hand I hope if I accidentally leave something behind, the maid cleaning the room will be nice enough to turn it in. The first day, the maid took the tip and left me a thank you note. The second day, I left the tip and checked out at around noon.That evening, I discovered that I had forgotten my laptop power adapter in the Sheraton hotel room. I called the hotel immediately. The guest service rep took my room number, dates of stay, name and phone number, and said that they would call me if someone turns it in. There was no indication that they are trying to look for it. I expect at least they should 1) if the room has not been rented out, send someone to check; or 2) if the room was rented out, send a message to the new guest.One week passed and no phone call. I called again because I was about to pass through Seattle. The guest service simply said that we have your inquiry on file. If it turns up, we will call you. Again no indication of any willingness to help.I know that leaving something behind is my mistake, but I am still disappointed that the hotel guest service is not as helpful as a 4-star hotel should be.
