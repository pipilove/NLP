Great Charm and Gentility

We arrived at the hotel at 8am, exhausted and rumpled from an all night flight across the Atlantic. The front desk, after appologizing that our room would not be ready til 1pm, immediately suggested we leave our baggage, utilize the lavatory facilities, send an email home announcing our arrival if we liked and enjoy a complimentary breakfast in the garden conservatory. Their attention and concern set the tone for our two night stay. While our room was small, it was nicely decorated, and quiet, overlooking their lovely garden. Their cafe au lait was the best we had during our 4 weeks in France. When I had a problem confirming a leased car, the desk staff helped me work through it. When I tried practicing my French, they politely answered in French. Since they all spoke excellent English, however, they also switched to English whenever I seemed confused or if I asked a question in English. The hotel's public space was cozy and charming, the location was great, the staff delightful. I would happily stay here again and recommend it to my friends.
