As good as the reviews say

We won't repeat the details in the previous reviews, but will just say that they are all true: this is a wonderful little hotel, absolutely spotlessly clean. Fine breakfast buffet. The location is spectacular, and the nearby #2 and 5 streetcars will take you everywhere (7-8 minute ride to within 4 blocks of the Anne Frank House, for example); we never waited more than 5 minutes for one. The Van Gogh museum is 75 yards away, and the Concertgebouw three blocks. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly. One earlier review carped about the small elevator: yes, it's not large, but two people plus some luggage fit easily, and most hotels don't have an elevator at all. Among the other amenities: free laundry service. Just an outstanding value, all around.
