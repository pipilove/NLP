Nadia Hotel; home from home

The Nadia Hotel is about the most friendly and comfortable place you can find. Osam the manager and his staff are always cheerful and the hotel, in a beautiful period building, is perfectly placed for access to the city centre.The rooms are small but with a canal view or a balcony its perfect. We have stayed at the Nadia three times and at our last visit, when we arrived we had flowers in our room with a 'welcome home' message.. That says it all! We love the Nadia and you will not find a better deal in central Amsterdam.
