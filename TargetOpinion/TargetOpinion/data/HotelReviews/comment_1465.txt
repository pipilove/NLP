what a disapointment

This hotel goes out of its way to make sure people do not return. Over priced slovenly appearance, shabby in places and many staff who do not appear to understand to easiest request.First room was like a rabbit hutch and smelly with paper peeling off wall.Up graded for a fee to a better room which was satisfactory but still badly in need of redecoration.No real sign of management at any time. A great let down after so much looking forward.
