Ok so long as you are not expecting 5 star

I had a mixed experience in relation to this hotel. Overall found most of the hotel staff to be very responsive  helpful. We also found the location to be very good for sightseeing, shopping, etc as well. I did however find the following to be very disappointing:飦?The bed was very uncomfortable  old飦?The air conditioning was turned off, even though it was cold outside our room was as hot as a sauna. The only option was to have the window open all of the time which made sleeping impossible due to noise from the street below.飦?The bathroom was very dated  disappointing, in particular I could not believe the shower was in a 5 star hotel.飦?Bathroom hairdryer is impossible to style your hair with, it took me 4 calls to the concierge before an alternative was provided.飦?Sometimes the staff on the concierge desk spoke almost no English which was frustrating.I am a very frequent traveller, I would not rate the hotel experience we had as 5 star, something on par with a 3 or 4 star but certainly not 5 star.
