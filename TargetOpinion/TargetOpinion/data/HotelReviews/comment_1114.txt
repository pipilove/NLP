Do not stay at the Brighton!!!

My husband and I, and my family, stayed in the Brighton Hotel after reading all the fantastic reviews on tripadvisor.com. I can honestly say I am baffled by this hotels high scores and glowing reviews.We stayed there for 5 nights and were extremely upset arriving at this dump of a hotel. Lift was tiny and totally out of the way. We walked down three long corridors to get to our room (on the other side of the hotel), all of which had the carpet literally peeling away with boards exposed, which felt like walking through an old haunted mansion the boards wobbled so much. We thought we were going to fall through to the level below!The staff, apart from one man (I assume was the boss) were pathetic. Especially at night. One red headed man was so rude and useless we were furious with him the entire time we were there. I've never come across a less helpful and totally rude receptionist. He was useless.The location was handy, but not good. VERY noisy. Don't stay here if you have a car. We were told by the useless receptionist there was parking just around the corner - we ended up parking about 4 blocks away. I could go on with the examples. The whole stay was just awful.Over all I would most definitely NOT recommend this hotel. It was the worst one I have stayed in in all of Europe. Unless they have gutted it it should have been pulled down long ago (and my families room was just as bad, so it wasn't only our floor or our room).If you're happy to use the public transport in Paris (which is easy) then I would stay at Les J'ardins D'Eiffel (unsure of spelling). I stayed there a few years ago. It's a lovely hotel, lovely staff (who also speak English and are handy with directions and suggestions), view of Eiffel Tower from the breakfast room and some bedrooms and delicious breakfasts, great splendid location down a little Parisian alley way a short walk from the Seine and Eiffel Tower.
