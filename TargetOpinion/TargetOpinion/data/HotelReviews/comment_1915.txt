You are paying for the view

My wife and I are staying at this hotel for four night. We travel a ton and have stayed at various level of hotels from 4 star to Exclusive. I dont care how this hotel is rated by various magazines. I would never stay here. It is dirty and the service is lacking. The views are great if you can see thru the windows. You may think you can relax, however the hotel is on a major highway. The pool is a truck length away from the highway. The photos on the Four Seasons web site do not match what you get. I would save the money and stay else where.
