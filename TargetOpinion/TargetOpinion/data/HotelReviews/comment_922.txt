not really kid friendly

we booked two rooms for a family holiday with our two young children. rooms are clean and quaint, location is good, but a few problems we encountered: no mini fridges in the rooms. not sure if this is common all over paris, but for the price, we were a bit surprised at this. as last reviewer mentioned, they were STINGY. apart from the breakfast, which he mentioned, we had two rooms in total, paying over $1,600 on our accomodation in total and we got one bottle of Evian water on the first day each per room- it was never replenished. they also do not provide shampoo at the hotel either, only bath gel. its pretty rough on the hair! Stingy is okay when you are paying stingy for the rooms, but here not!and lastly, service incident to end our trip left a sour taste- we had already checked out and were killing time in the very parlour downstairs. i asked the receptionist if she could help warm up my kids milk for us. 15 min later, i knew the milk would be too hot for the kids to drink, so asked two different people to bring out the milk- no response- 5 people milling around reception, everyone seems too busy to bother with our milk. another 5 minutes later and the milk comes out, and as predicted too hot to even hold. lady said ca va? and i replied that it was too hot, she says in french, well, you'll just have to leave it out and wait then ...turned on her heels and stormed off, clearly annoyed and not interested in helping me anymore to get my kids their milk. nice touch.all maybe normal for paris, but for the price, not exactly impressive... its redeeming quality is that there are two (and only two!) very very friendly and helpful staff at the hotel- too bad not everyone there is...
