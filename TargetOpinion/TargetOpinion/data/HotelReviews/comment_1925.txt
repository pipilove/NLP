Not a Four Seasons Experience

I was disappointed with our stay at the four seasons since it was not the standard that I expected it to be although considering the price that we paid for the room via hotel club, I should not have been surprised.The receptionists and all of the staff were very helpful and friendly on the plus side. Also our breakfasts were good.On the downside, our room was very small, the choice of movies was poor, the swimming pool area was very dated and not positioned in a good place right under the flyover. One of our evening meals (taken in the room) was dried out and not of a great standard and the vegetarian options in the restaurant were not brilliant.Despite many reviewers saying how comfortable the beds are, my partner and I prefer our beds a little harder and we had trouble sleeping for the first two nights as we were lost in both the beds and the pillows. A bed board which was added did not help although we were grateful for the offer.
