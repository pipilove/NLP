Location is A+ everything else is a C

We chose the Hotel Brighton following glowing reviews on Trip Advisor... great view, clean etc...Well we got to the Hotel and the location IS spot on; just 2 minutes walk from the Louvre, 2 minutes from Place de la Concorde on Rue de Rivoli and with a super view of the Eiffel Tower (so I hear...).We were a bit dissappointed with the room allocated to us. The concierge informed us that we could have a renovated room so we were imagining a bit of luxury. As it turned out our room was small and functional. It had air-con a tv and a minibar, but that was basically it. The bathroom was small but sufficient with an ok size shower. The room was on the E/S floor (1st floor) meaning it was just below the arches of the Rue de Rivoli so no view at all but plenty of road noise.The Hotel Brighton has no restaurant or bar. They do serve petit-dejeuner on a morning for EURO 8 per person.
