Great 5 day stay

I was very pleasently surprised with the service of this hotel. They do a lot of little things that show they care about their guests. The hotel is old but kept up very well. The Wireless Internet service works great but if you don't have a computer they also have one available by the front desk for guests to use. The bathrooms are a little small and I felt that it could have been a little cleaner but I consider myself to have very high standards when it comes to how clean the bathrooms are. We stayed one night at the Downtown Hilton during this visit and would pick the Chancellor over the Hiton any day.
