Reservation non-refundable

We had airline connection problems and didn't get to Seattle until the day after our reservation which was for Saturday. We missed the cruise ship. When we called on Saturday afternoon (from San Jose where we were stranded in the airport) and wanted to rebook for Sunday night, the hotel refused to refund the cost of Saturday night. Wouldn't discuss the situation. No refunds was their policy and that was that.
