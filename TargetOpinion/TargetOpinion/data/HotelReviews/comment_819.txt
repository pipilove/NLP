Nice place, nice location

We stayed at the Velvet over New Year 08/09 and it cost æ‹¢70 per night, booking with the hotel's website.Finding the hotel was very easy - the nearest S-Bahn station is a very short walk away. Upon arrival I was impressed at the modern look and feel of the Velvet and the reception was pleasing. We were allocated a street facing room on the sixth floor so had the benefit of a floor to ceiling window - the views are great! I was a little disappointed with the room - the quality was excellent - but our bed was nothing more than a pull out sofa type and our room was 601.1 which had an adjoining door so I suspect that when the hotel isn't full, they treat our room as 601's sitting area to make 601 a Suite-type room. We also didn't experience the middle-of-room shower!Having said the above, it is a nice hotel and I wouldn't hesitate to return.Wireless Internet is free in public areas and Cabled Internet is chargeable in the room - I think it's 12 Euro a day.We didn't eat in the hotel at all, so I cannot comment on catering standards.
