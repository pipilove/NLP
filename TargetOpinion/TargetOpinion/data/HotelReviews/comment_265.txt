I booked the hotel for a weekend's stay. It's very near to Centraal Station, which is great if coming from the airport. The Hotel itself is right near Dam Square, and 5 minutes from the Red Light District - so you're near the action!I had booked a Superior room and was given a single superior. The room was spacious, but the bed was a small double - no real issue there but I expected a standard hotel double (Queen) - there is a difference. The people next door were quite noisy, so I asked if I could be moved, and reception moved me to a superior double - good staff. The room (superior) - big, spacious room. Clean and furnished to general 4-star hotel standards. A large desk for business travellers with an excellent leather desk chair. An expresso coffee machine was a pleasant surprise. A clean and excellent (with above average pressure) shower. The bed was disappointing. Looking like a kingsize, it's actually two doubles thrown together - careful you don't fall through the gap! My room, as with most of the rooms had no view. And expect to hear noises from most of the rooms - unless you specifically ask for a quiet one!The Hotel doesn't have a lobby as such - just a reception area and a sofa round the side. The restauraunt is small but there's no excuse to be eating there, when there's a whole city to explore. Breakfast menu is restricted and expensive.In summary - the superior room is of good size but the two beds thrown together was disappointing. Having no view was also disappointing but as a tourist, one shouldn't be spending too much time inside. The staff seemed friendly and overall, whilst I wouldn't stay there again, I didn't wholly like or dislike my stay. Average is the only conclusion to give...
