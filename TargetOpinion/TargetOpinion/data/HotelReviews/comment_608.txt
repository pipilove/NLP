Terrible Rooms - Great Breakfast

Stayed at the hotel over Easter 2005. This hotel is in two parts the new and the old. The new is 4 star and the old is 2 star. When we arrived we were impressed by the lobby and the friendly staff. When we were shown to our room we were given a twin bedded room in the old part of the hotel. We had booked a double bed. We were moved to a slightly better double room (two beds purshed together) but still in the old part of the hotel. The rooms in the old part are described as Classic. Avoid these rooms - it is very clear why they do not have a photograph of them on their web site. The rooms are shabby, the air conditioing did not work (left the balcony door wide open all night in March!), soft furnishings grubby, smelt unpleasant, the toilet broke (still not offered a change of room).The only positive things to say about the hotel is that it is in a very good location, the breakfast is excellent, friendly staff and lovely lobby with pianist. Even with these benefits I would not recommend staying in this hotel. I do not know what the quality of the rooms are like in the new part of the hotel.I would certainly never stay in this hotel again.
