Wonderful Hotel

Just returned from Berlin, Germany and the Savoy Hotel was quite nice. Be prepared that most Berlin hotels do NOT have air conditioning! The Savoy only has room suites on the 6th floor with air conditioning. We upgraded directly with the hotel. Our suite was decorated tastefully with Chagall prints and very comfortable. The hotel's cleanliness is superb. The 6th floor however, is NOT non-smoking; I was concerned about this, but it wasn't an issue. They have a wonderful hot breakfast buffet that was included in our stay, the dining room is elegant! I would certainly stay there again. The staff was very pleasant, and the location was perfect. I booked the hotel online before our trip. ++++
