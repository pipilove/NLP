terrible hotel

My room was dim in the mezzanine. Stopping the key and the bath was broken. However, they were not mended. There was a day from which the hot water did not come out either. The bath towel used hung to the rack as it was occasionally. It cannot be thought very three Ts-star. It never stays at this hotel.
