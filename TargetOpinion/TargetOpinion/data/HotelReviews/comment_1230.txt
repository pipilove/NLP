Chancellor was A-PLUS!!!!

I stayed at the Chancellor during June 8-15, the staff was very helpful, the location was wonderful, the room was Very Nice, and overall I was very Impressed. The room was very nicely decorated, very quite. The only negative was the size of the bathroom was small but with amenties like the Pillow menu, the cookies and the coffee/tea there is really nothing I can find fault with. Mr Tyler was also very Helpful in all of my requests and I will defintely be back!I left my heart in San Francisco .....
