Having just returned from my third stay at the four points, I feel I should shed some light on this hotel. My first stay was appauling, went back to my room one night in tears after being treated rudely by the restaurant staff. Second stay was excellent, treated like a queen (possibly some notes were made after my previous encounter)..and was happy to book again this year. It seems its 50/50 as to the service you get. My current stay was nothing short of 1 star. I payed a premium rate for a suite as a preferred guest. After being given a room on the second floor with unacceptable street noise, when I requested a change, I was rudely told by staff no chance. I then discovered that people who payed a substantially lower rate over the internet last minute sites were given better rooms and services, including complementary champagne..none for those who are willing to pay it seems! The breakfast is appauling, greasy, and of a low food standard,all frozen and prepackaged food, plus, you are packed in like sardines if you arive after 9am! The bathroom was mouldy and the bed linen ripped and torn. No table was supplied in the room, making working or eating n the room very difficult!! I agree that the location is good, but for what they claim, you should expect a better level of standard service. If you are planning to stay, don't book a premium room, and book over a last minute site like wotif, much better rates and deals are offered, and don't pay extra for buffet breakfast! For much the same price, you could stay at the parent property, sheraton on the park, which, despite some reviews i've read, is far, far superior!!
