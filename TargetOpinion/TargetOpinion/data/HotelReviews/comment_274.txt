Gracious living

In October 2006, I took my children on a European holiday and chose the Seven Bridges Hotel, Amsterdam, for our last two nights. I am partial to antiques and wonderful soft furnishings, which is why I chose this hotel.Another attraction was the age of the place...300 years old! It more than satisfied my expectations. We were given room 5, a large, magnificently furnished room to share, with its own balcony overlooking a private garden at the rear of the hotel, away from the noise and bustle of the canals. We had our own marble ensuite and a flat screen TV, which the children loved. Each morning, the owners brought a breakfast tray to our room, full of delicious fresh food, served on fine china....what a way to be pampered! The room was tastefully decorated with fine antiques and rich fabrics, Persian carpets and interesting artworks.We were right next to the canal, so made use of the canal cruises and enjoyed ambling along the cobbled streets and looking at galleries and shops. At night, we found a few restaurants nearby and were close to major shops and bus routes on the Rembrandtplein. Amsterdam is a joy to explore and we all loved the relaxed feel of the place and the tolerance of the Dutch to different customs. The owners were most accommodating in storing our luggage and calling taxis or advising us where to go and I would definitely like to return to this hotel.We paid 550 euros for two nights, which included the breakfast and all taxes.
