A Nice Touist-Class Hotel

Stayed here based on reviews on the site. My goal was to stay at a nice place at less than 200 euros a night. My single was 155 euros, I think my aunt and uncle paid 185 euros for their double. Location: I loved Rue Cler. Come out of the hotel and go right. There's a grocery store right there. Then, at the corner--cafe on each side--there's a great pedestrian foodie street. Bakeries, fruit stalls, really great looking Italian butcher, and more. Some great photo opps and just a peaceful place to hang given the lack of traffic.I did not use the Metro this time, so I can't comment on proximity to Metro stations. It's about a 10-15 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower. And 10 to 15 mins to the Seine.Rooms: They are neat and tidy. Nothing fantastic. They have Air Conditioning. Also, if you bring your laptop, they'll give you a code for free wireless. There are also two PCs in the lobby, which I thought was a nice touch. One thing I liked about the rooms is that they'd given some thought as to how to prevent wear and tear on the walls...for example, on the floor behind the nightstands, there were wooden blocks to prevent the furniture from hitting the wall and leaving marks all the time.Breakfast was not included in my rate and was 15 euros. As per previous, there are lots of cafes in the area, so you can do cheaper somewhere else. (But as my uncle pointed out, you have to wait for someone to serve you somewhere else. The buffet might be nice if you're in a hurry.)All in all, I couldn't fault the Relais Bosquet. It's a nice place. If you're looking for something trendy or really modern and brand new, this isn't the place for you. (Try the Duret, which I've stayed in previously and although it's not super-central, I like the modern feel of the rooms.) But if you're looking for some place clean and tidy and friendly, the Relais Bosquet is a very solid choice.
