A great hotel---NOT EVEN CLOSE

Spent a week at the Arts. From underwhelming service, to overcrowded elevators to operators sometimes never answering the phones, to night time turn down service happening three of our six nights, to a 45 minute wait for a chair at the pool, to ordering a draft beer (which cost 11 euro by the way) at 11AM and STILL never getting it to meeting people who ordered at 20 euro pizza at 1:00 who are still waiting for it to show up...to waiting for an elevator for 10 to 15 minutes at times, THIS IS A POORLY RUN hotel!! Some of the staff go out of their way to be wonderful for sure, but the vast majority seem totally overwhelmed by the crowds. If you have been to other Ritz Carlton properties before, and expect the same experience here, you're NOT going to get it. We ran into people in the elevator we didn't even know, and they all said, this hotel sucks. I would say if you are looking for a deluxe experience in Barcelona...look elsewhere. Tbe rooms did have awesome showers though!!
