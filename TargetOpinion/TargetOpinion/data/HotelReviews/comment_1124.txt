Should be better

Stayed between Christmas and New Year, location of hotel was fantastic being just yards from the parks. Hotel was full and did not appear to have communal areas and restaurants designed to cope with the number of guests staying.The hotel seems torn between trying to be a run of the mill 4/5 star hotel and a true deluxe hotel. The furnishings are generally good although the bathrooms are not in keeping being utilitarian rather than luxury.The hotel communal areas are to small compared to the number of rooms, the bar area was always crowded with people standing around waiting for a seat to become available and staff who seemed to have no interest in clearing tables or providing service unless it was at their convenience.The lobby is similar.Although staff professed that they were always available to help service standards were only average for a hotel charging top end prices. Mistakes in service were a constant theme, problems were always sorted out but a high level of errors suggested a general lack of care and training. The staff generally fail to give the proactive service which is present in a top hotel.If you want the convenience of a hotel immediately adjacent to the parks this is the best available hotel but with average service. The absence of true deluxe hotel competition seems to have led Disney to accept average as sufficient.
