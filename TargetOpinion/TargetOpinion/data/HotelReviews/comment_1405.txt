Room bate and switch after arrical

I booked a room with 2 queen beds here on the internet over a month in advance. Upon arrival I was told that the room was only available for the first night but that they would put me in two separate rooms on separate floors one with one full bed and one with a twin bed. As we were traveling with our two teen sons this was not a reasonable option, they both would not fit in a twin bed nor were we comfortable with separate floors. The owners insist on blaming the internet provider saying that the providers oversell the rooms. Even backing it up with horror stories of several times people came in from overseas with 2 week reservations that they had to turn away. I have booked rooms though the internet multiple times and never had this problem, all the other motels I stayed at had a block of room available for the internet providers that they would not sell themselves. I believe this motel will sell the rooms that people buy on the internet and trade the internet customers down to their lower end rooms. I didn't mention that the hotels direct quote was 42 dollars higher per night then the prices available on the web at the same time. We cancelled the second night and found another hotel. Needless to say I would never stay there again.
