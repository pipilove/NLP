We have in the past relied on the opinions posted on Tripadvisor for hotels in Dominican Republic, Las Vegas, G/Canyon and Los Angeles. Thankfully ALL have been excellent hotels as recommended. So we obviously looked on Tripadvisor for an hotel in Paris. We can honestly say that we wish we hadn't. I'm not sure if the people who posted the earlier reviews stayed at the same hotel as we did! I've heard that the hotel rooms in Paris are small but I didn't realise how small they can be! The bedroom was a double with only just enough room for what looked like a rather small and very hard and uncomfortable double bed. There was very little storage for any clothes for our 4 night stay. The room although clean had a large stain in the carpet and looked as if it hadn't been painted for at least 5 years. The bathroom was clean and although small proved adequate, with plenty of hot water on tap at all times of the day. There were no windows in the room just a large set of French doors that we had to leave open as it was in the mid 80's during our stay. Outside was noisy at times, but I guess that applies to many hotels in Paris. Thankfully the hotel provided us with a large fan that kept the room temperature to a bearable level. The walls appeared paper thin, but thankfully people around us seemed to share our waking/bed times. The brakfast was well worth the extra cost being a typical continental affair served at your table in a small brakfast room. The hotel is a good 15 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower and only a few minutes walk away from a well connected Metro station. The staff were generally hepful and reasonably friendly. Overall we would say that the hotel was no more than adequate. I find it hard to believe that there aren't other better hotels in Paris at the same and probably cheaper price. My advice is to carry on searching Tripadvisor for another hotel.
