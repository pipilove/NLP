Not as good as the other reviews

The best part about this hotel is the location. It is very close to Circular Quay, The Rocks, The Bridge and the Opera House. I didn't find the staff all that friendly, although I wasn't dressed in a suit. The food available at the hotel was mostly buffett style, breakfast was $32.00 and bad. Eat elsewhere. I had a Deluxe Opera View room, which was a good view of the Sydney Opera House.
