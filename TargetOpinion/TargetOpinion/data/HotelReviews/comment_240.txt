Great location

Staying at the Hotel Nadia was a great experience for us. The staff couldn't be more accomodating - they will insist on making the check in and check out process easy. There are steep stairs up to the check in desk, but for a true Netherlands experience, the steep stairs are worth it. The breakfast is mostly bread, coffee, and juice, but it's presented well and the breakfast room was clean. The bedroom was clean as was the bath. One of the best things about the hotel is the security - there is a buzzer to get in and the front desk is manned 24 hours. The hotel is ideally located with a great view of Westerkirk church and within easy walking distance to some worthwhile stops such as the Anne Frank House  the Theater museum.
