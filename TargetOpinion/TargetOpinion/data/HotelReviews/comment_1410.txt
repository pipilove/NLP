Pleasant place to stay and a good location

A good spot for our family of 4 including 2 teenagers. We had very a large room (large kitchen area with table, bedroom area with 2 queens and a sofa bed) at the back of the motel on the top floor - which unlike the previous reviewers room had a panoramic view over the city (not the courtyard) we could even see the top of the Golden Gate bridge though I believe we had the only room with this view. The decor was perhaps a little dated but all was clean. No problems with TV or phone and free wireless Internet was huge bonus for daughter who wanted to catch up with her friends back home. We found the location excellent for us, walking distance to most things and SF public transport is excellent. We avoided breakfast at the hotel completely and went to Polkers on Polk Street (as recommended by the staff) for superb breakfasts (pancakes, waffles etc etc etc you name it they do it), we also had an evening meal there which was also excellent and very good value.We found the staff at Nob Hill were very welcoming and friendly (despite having to wait up late for us due to a cancelled flight) They were extremely helpful giving us lots of local info, places to see (areas to avoid) etc.If I was to give a couple of tips for staying in San Francisco they would be avoid Fishermans wharf unless you like really touristy trash and if you want to make the trip to Alcatraz in the summer book it before you go - we hadn't done this and found all the trips were booked up for the whole week.
