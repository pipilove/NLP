Amazing Escape

When we first arrived, we were not that excited. Had to carry our bags across Las Rambas ( a zoo) and came in the door off Las Ramblas....not greating. And checked into the room- seems small. HOWEVER, as we stayed, and explored and got to know the staff, and the restaurant and the business center and the QUALITY of all of the amenities and service, it became one of my most favorite hotels in the world. I think because it is just off Las Ramblas, the lobby is even more inviteing- a peaceful retreat from the crazy street. Was absolutly worth every penny.
