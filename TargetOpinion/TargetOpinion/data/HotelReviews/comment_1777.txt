Gives new meaning to sleepless in Seattle

If you want to sleep, this hotel isn't for you. The mattresses are so soft they are guaranteed to give you a backache you won't forget. We tried two rooms, but were told all he mattresses were the same and unfortunately, we couldn't book rooms anywhere else within our budget for the remaining two nights of our four-night stay. By the end of it, both of us were glad to leave.The location of the hotel is nice. There are inexpensive restaurants in the area and we walked everywhere--Seattle Center is basically across the street and downtown (and Pike Place Market) is only about 3 miles from the hotel. The staff is accomodating--they were willing to refund us our room rate if we moved to a new hotel. Having a fridge and microwave in the room, as well as coin-operated washers and driers off the lobby was very nice--as was the small work-out room. But our vacation was ruined by lack of sleep.
