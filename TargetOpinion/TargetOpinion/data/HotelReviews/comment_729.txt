Don't Stay Here!!!

At first I was happy with my stay until a the last night before my departure from Berlin when I could not withdraw any money from my account! It turns out that the hotel blocks the amount of money of your stay PLUS a 100 euros for the mini bar in your account WITHOUT telling you!! The problem is that I specifically asked when checking in if any money will be deducted from my card and they said NO. So You can imagine when I was shocked that 750 dollars had disappeared from my checking account during my stay there. The hotel not only didn't realize the severity of the problem that this may create for some travelers, especially if one is traveling alone... but they also proceeded to NOT compensate me for even one nights stay or offer to make my stay more pleasant. Not only these things happened to me during my stay but my friends bathroom flooded his room and the hotel was not so keen on the idea of him changing rooms even though his entire carpet floor was soaking wet! In all , you pay for the location, so don't expect anything special at this hotel.... just a cheap room with a good view. Overall, unpleasant experience.
