Not what i expected

For our four nights in one of the tinkerbell suites i must say that i was somewhat disappointed with the level of service we received and the overall standard of the hotel.Firstly the air conditioning just didn't do anything other than blow hot air no matter what its setting was. The sofa bed actually collapsed the second night, for which there was apparently no replacement available. We ended up having two additional single beds in our living room for the remaining duration of our stay. No apology offered.Room service turn around times were terrible (typically 50 minutes plus, one night 70 minutes). It would appear that the overall planning for the influx of families was poor - when you saw the length of the queue for breakfast every morning downstairs you did have to question the ability of the hotel to handle the number of bookings they had.In comparison to many hotels which we have stayed in around the world, the service offered by this hotel was miles behind what we had received elsewhere.My recommendation now to others is either stay here just one night, or stay in a proper hotel in Paris and catch the train!
