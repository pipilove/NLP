Great hotel Great location in the heart of sydney close to Circular Quay.

Our room was big and has a great bathroom - absolutely spotless. Ate in the bar one night and food was good if a bit expensive but I guess you expect that in Sydney!!Friendly and helpful staff who booked restaurant tables for us etc. and checked us in early morning after a long flight!!!Small Gym but decent pool.Great hotel for the price.
