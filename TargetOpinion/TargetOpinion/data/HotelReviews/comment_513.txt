dissapointed with expensive nice hotel,

I just returned from barcelona spain, vienna, prague, budapest and munich germany,Barcelona , spain,- do not stay at the clarion pulitzer near las ramblas, I arrived in the evening, they took my credit card, passport information, and I had requested a restaurant for me and my kids to go out to eat at. we went out, came back, and the next morning when i wanted to ck out. there was a dinner charge from the hotel on my bill, the only way, from that evening until the next morning to get a charge on my bill was from the staff using my information and trying to sign the dinner charge with my name. to my room. In other words make sure you ck your bill before leaving the hotel. they have some scam going on . Las ramblas is not a safe area, either are the subways, the so called gypsies are causing distractions so others can pickpocket you, i witness it on the subway with an accordian player. they work in teams . I saw wallets getting passed and within seconds the person was off the subway. be careful. the food in barcelona was not the best either unless you like shrimp w/the heads on them or at fancy restaurants. the hoof and leg of the animal clamped in a device in the middle of the dining room, it was not very appealing to me. On the positive side, there is alot to do there, the on /off sightseeing bus was wonderful, sagradia familiar is best to see 1st thing in the morning, climbing up all the stairs, is definitly tiring on the legs, they shook for 5 minutes after i came down. the view is amazing up there, yes and there is a elevator with a long wait. anyways, glad to be back in the usa!!!
