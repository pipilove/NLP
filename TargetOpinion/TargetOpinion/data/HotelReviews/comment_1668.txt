W Needs S'more Customer Service

While the room itself was pretty nice, with a good view and an alcove couch, I was not impressed by the rest of the hotel. I spent two weeks emailing back and forth with the whatever whenever service at the W Seattle to try to arrange for a special fantasy camping surprise for my fiance who loves to camp. We finally came up with s'mores, which the woman from the whatever whenever service told me the kitchen could definitely do. She priced it out for me, and I okayed it and asked for it at 10 PM, when we were due to arrive. It was not ready for us, and the man at the front desk told me that it could be done the next day at 3 PM. We rushed back to our room the next day to make it there by 3 PM, but no s'mores. I called the front desk to ask what happened. Apparently, no one went out to get the materials and I was asked if I could wait another 45 minutes to an hour. We had dinner reservations with friends whom we had not seen in quite some time, so I had to say no. Nothing was offered to compensate for this fiasco, not even a sincere apology. I was asked if the manager could call me, and I said that would be fine. The manager never called me. Only when I complained the following day at check out was anything done. I was given two tickets for free drinks at the W Bar and told not to spend over $15 dollars per drink! This was all extremely rude. I have never had a problem in another hotel like this. Friends of mine who have had problems at hotels have received more of a concerned response from staff and management. This hotel definitely did not have five-star service!
