Lots to recommend this hotel

The Rex has a lot of positives. It is well located, near Union Square with lots of shops and restaurants nearby. The staff are friendly and the rooms, while small, are clean and well furnished. There is free wireless Internet access in the rooms and another nice touch is the free glass of wine served between 5 and 6 - this ensures the guests gravitate to the lounge and creates a warm, friendly atmosphere.We had breakfast in the restuarant and it was good although there are plenty of other good restaurants and diners nearby.The only fault we would find is in the lack of tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms. All in all, a good value mid range hotel.
