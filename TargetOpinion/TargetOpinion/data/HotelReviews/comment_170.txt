Would not recommend

Stayed here recently and their idea of a 4* and mine are difinately different. Room looked nothing like the expedia picture, no coverlet and bed linen was not changed in the 3 days we stayed there.Enterance hall was lovely but don't be fooled by the Superior room this is the basic room.
