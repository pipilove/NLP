Save yourself!!!!! 3/3/05 Please read this !

Just got back. The worst hotel I have stayed at in 27 years.The reception staff are rude, aggressive and disinterested in any comments you may have. The rooms were a good size, but its like being in the boiler room of an ocean steamer. The beds were so saggy they nearly touched the floor once you had got on them, the pillows were like wafers.It claims to be a four star hotel, think again, no tea or coffee making facilities, no ironing board, no bathrobes, no in room toiletries, nor local information or hotel information can be found in the room. To obtain room service I was transfered 4 times to different hotel departments. The only good thing was the bar staff in the hotel lobby, they were kind, polite and friendly. Are you listening Park Inn? Put them on the reception desk, to replace the miserable and arrogant people you have there now. Dont waste your hard earned money on these people. Just to clarify, we had an upgraded Business Class room. Save yourselves!!!!!
