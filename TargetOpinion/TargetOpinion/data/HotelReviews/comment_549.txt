Fabulous hotel! Highly recommended!!!

My husband and I stayed at the Jazz Hotel for 2 nights Sept. 9-11, 2005. We couldn't have been more pleased....this hotel is wonderful! The location is perfect - so close to La Rambla and steps away from Placa Catalunya, which makes getting to and from the airport (by Aerobus or by train) very easy. We loved the ultra modern decor in the bedroom and bathroom. The rooftop terrace has a pool which is quite small but has a nice view. We loved this hotel and highly recommend it to anyone visiting Barcelona.
