4 star status unjustified - very overpriced, tired and dated

We were very disappointed with our room which was vastly overpriced at 270 Euros. It was clean, but tiny, dark , tired and looked onto a very unappealing courtyard. Whilst the range of foods available for break fast was good, it was served in a very cramped, claustrophobic room with no windows. Priced at 22 Euros breakfast was, again, hugely overpriced. Whilst the hotel is undoubtedly well sited for exploring key sites and the staff were reasonably friendly, we failed to see how the 4 star hotel rating is justified and would put this hotel as no more than two star standard.
