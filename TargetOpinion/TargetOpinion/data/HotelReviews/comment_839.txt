Good value

We stayed here in May, 2005 and were very happy with it. Good sized room, well equipped (though no hairdryer - available from reception). Small lobby/bar with coffee/alcohol for sale. Excellent breakfast. Staff friendly and helpful. Virtually on Ku'damm but about a mile along from zoo station (though there are two U/S Bahm stations nearer including Savigny Platz which is wheelchair accessible). The hotel is wheelchair accessible. A very good value eating place within a 100m is the Melrose - recommended
