Be aware here!

Can be a good hotel in a great location. The only thing I'd be aware of is the big difference in rooms. Some rooms are bigger and nicer than others. Lots of variations. I've stayed here numerous times and have seen at least 5 different styles of rooms in the same price catagory. If you don't like where you're at, ask to change. Has a really nice buffet and bufett room though, and all the services of a big nice hotel. Not a first choice for me, because of the room variation. We often have to go for conferences however.
