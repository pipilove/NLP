good hotel but not mutch good if they give your room to someone else

We arrived in france and found our hotel without too mutch difficulty .On arrival at reception were told that our room had been let to a group staying at the hotell that wanted to stay in the one hotell together. We told the receptionist that that wasn't good enough as we had recieved confirmation by email. We were told that there was a mix up with the bookings and she recomended us to take a room at the Modial Hotel a few doors away, the room was small and badly in need of modernisation and depressing to say the least, we were then moved to a larger room after our protests we stayed two days and then at last were roomed in the France Albion for the last two days of our stay in Paris.
