Business hotel in the middle of nowhere

I麓ve stayed in this hotel twice - in June 2006 and now, in January for business matter and it is definately not for tourists. It is a large business hotel with lot of people and always very crowded. But the rooms have nice art deco feeling and are really big (what is rare in Paris) and the staff in concierge and reception desk is friendly and nice. The service at the breakfast was horrible - slow and unpolite. Breakfast itself was quite generous with lots of juices, hot and cold dishes, fish, cheese, pancakes - you name it! I also liked the Purple bar which is also popular among locals.Bathroom was very small and has CrabtreeEvelyn amenities.When I first time stayed in Hilton Arc de Triomphe, I also had some problems with the room service - they did麓nt clean the room and they forgot turndown service.Overall - if You don麓t mind to move around by taxi (it costs 7-8 euros to Louvre area for example and 47 euros to airport) and You don麓t mind, that the hotel is overcrowded and noisy, then go for it! But if You prefer more personal touch and intimate feeling and historical atmosphere and to be close to the lively city center, then it is definately not for You.
