I'll NEVER stay there again!!

Being a hotelier myself with a 5* hotel chain in Asia, Westin St. Francis is really not up to par. I stayed there in Sept 2005. When me and my family arrived after a long flight from Hong Kong, we were already very tired. Still, we had to deal with the long check-in process just because the staff there were so inexperience and didn't really know what they were doing. So finally, after maybe 30 mins, we finally got to our rooms - at the old wings. All I can say about the room was - TERRIBLE!!! It's old and small. A little like the BB in a small country side in the UK. I would never have expected that from a so-called 5* hotel like that! The bathroom was also extremely small and basic. With white tiles and a almost rusted shower head. It was no way that I would pay that amount of money for that type of room. So finally after a serious complaint, they moved us to the new wing which was more decent. A little more like what you have expected from an international hotel chain. But still, we have decided to change to the Grand Hyatt after a few days coz the Westin's service is so too terrible - slow delivery of our luggage (we'd to call 3 times b4 they brought it up) and my relative even got her handbag stolen in the lobby coffee shop. The only thing I can say about this hotel is the location, but then Grand Hyatt is just round the corner also and I would rather stay there. For business travellers or young executives who are used to the 5* international chains, Westin St Francis is not for you.
