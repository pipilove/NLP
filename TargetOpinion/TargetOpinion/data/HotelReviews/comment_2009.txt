Decent hotel

Stayed here during mid-January. Rooms were small but adequate and staff were as polite and efficient as those at most other hotels. The benefits of this hotel are it's location and it's price (web specials at AS$99!). The downside is that there is an absolute inflexibility on the part of staff to release rooms before 2pm - a little frustrating if arriving on an early flight. All in all very good value.
