Fabulous Hotel!!

My boyfriend and I stayed at the Omni San Francisco May 27-31st. We had a wonderful stay and I could not recommend this hotel more highly! The room was beautiful and spacious and extermely clean. I have never stayed in hotel room more spotless than this one. Even our spare toilet paper roll was wrapped in pink ribbon!!The doormen were always at the ready to open the door or help if you had any questions. The service here is impeccable. We had a problem with our toilet one night and the service person arrived in less than 5 minutes and had it fixed immediately. The location of this hotel is perfect. It's away from the hustle and bustle of Fisherman's wharf and the seedier Union Square. We rented a car and were glad we did as the lines for the cable cars were extremely long-being a holiday weekend. To avoid paying for parking, if you are there on a weekend and have the patience to find a spot, you can park overnight on the street if your meter isn't chargeable on weekends. Otherwise, if you park one block up at the St Mary's garage, it's about $20.00---which beats the $50 you have to pay to park at the hotel.I recommend this property to anyone who is going to San Francisco. EXCELLENT hotel and will absolutely stay here again!!
