Certainly a mixed bag, here

We stayed at The Westin Grand Hotel and it was just fine. We had a great time in Berlin and the hotel served its purpose. However, it was not spectacular for a few reasons.1. At first we got an unrenovated room. This was not too miserable but we asked to be upgraded in rooms after my back started hurting from the bed. I was under the impression that ALL beds were the so called Heavenly bed and boy were we wrong! The funny thing is, my husband is usually the one with the back pain!When we changed to a renovated room were were delighted with the bathroom but still stumped at exactly what was so heavenly about the bed. It was hard and REALLY uncomfortable. (We were making jokes about it being left over from the Communist era. Tee hee hee)2. Terrible smell of sewers down the corridors of hotel although, thankfully not in our room.3. The main conceirge did not give me a warm and fuzzy feeling. He seemed harried and annoyed at me asking too many questions. He recommended the restaurant Stamhouse which is part of the hotel. It was a sportsbar type place and the food was really not good. The main staff of the hotel were all very nice and they had a bunch of baby supplies for us that were helpful. Not a bad choice, but I wonder if we could have done a bit better...
