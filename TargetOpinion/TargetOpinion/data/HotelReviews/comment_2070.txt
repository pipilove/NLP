Might be okay on a budget...

Good location, great neighborhood. The hotel looked very good online and had a certain Bohemian chic to it in person. The bed itself was spacious, comfortable and clean.The room in general also seemed clean, but the mold in the bathroom was so overwhelming we had to check out early to avoid it affecting my husband's allergies and asthma. Manager gave us no problems over our early check out.
