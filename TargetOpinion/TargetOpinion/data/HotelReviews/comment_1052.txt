Friendly, But...

My family stayed in Hä¹ˆtel Louvre Sainte Anne for 4 nights in early August. I was very disappointed by what I found. Pros: - friendly staff- quietCons:- rooms are vert old and dark- rooms are tiny, even with European hotel standards- our room had dirty sheets upon arrival- location is not as close to the Louvre as I thought - you'd have to walk quite a bit, and not close to any other major attractions.It might be a good value for the low price you pay, but if vacationing in Paris is a once-in-a-life-time experience for you, this hotel will not cut it for you. It didn't feel like a hotel that I wanted to return to after a day of enjoying beautiful museums and sceneries.I'd definitely look for a better hotel next time, even if it means spending a lot more money.
