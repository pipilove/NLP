Fabulous stay at the Argonaut

We stayed at the Argonaut for 5 nights this month from 9th to 14th March and had a fabulous stay. Quick and efficient check in with Mikel. Room very clean, beds comfortable, no view though as standard rooms overlooking each other.Problems encountered with T.V. and safe resolved quickly. Good location and next door to cable car turnaround that takes you right through to Union Square. Never had to open the door once the doormen always there to hand. Blue Mermaid restaurant disappointing we had a poor meal there. Wine tasting in the evening very relaxed and friendly altough my only criticism of this hotel would be on our last night, we were chatting to some people we had met and it was close to 6 o'clock. I had drunk half my glass of wine so my husband took it back along with his for a top up. The man serving this night refused to do this stating the glass was half full, this embarrassed my husband as everyone else had received more than one glass in fact the people stopping at the conference had someone circulating with the wine topping them up. This guy must of realised he had been rude and embarrassed my husband as he approached him 10 minutes later and offered to top the glasses up as the wine tasting had finished. Shame this encounter happened as it would be my only criticsm of the hotel, I would definately stop there again but drink my wine faster to avoid any embarrassment!!
