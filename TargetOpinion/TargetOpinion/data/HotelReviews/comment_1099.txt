Great Find

Based on Tripadvisor reviews, I booked a three-night stay at the Langlois in Paris for a business trip. The staff was just great. (The night concierge even had hot coffee ready for me before I took off for my flight at 5am!) My room was very clean and quiet. However, I was very disappointed that the wi-fi service did not work in the guest rooms--at least not mine. The guest computer in the lobby had very spotty and slow service, too. The staff seemed surprised that the service wasn't functioning properly (not at all during my brief stay) so perhaps they'll address soon. I wouldn't have booked a room at a hotel without internet access.
