The best location in Sydney

I absolutely loved the Sydney Marriott Harbour. The best location, right by Circular Quay/The Rocks. The hotel have beautiful rooms, very friendly service and a convenient business center. We used the internet every day to stay in touch at home. We ate breakfast at the hotel in the morning. Very good food and a good price. I loved everything about the service I received and the room I booked. Very comfortable beds! I want to go back, and if I do I will only stay at this hotel!
