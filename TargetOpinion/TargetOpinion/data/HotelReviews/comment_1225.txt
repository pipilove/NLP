Very tired hoel in great location

This very tired looking hotel in a great location. My room was very dated and had a view of a high wall, stair well and fire escape! The bathroom looked as though it had not been decorated since the end of Word War 2! On the plus side the staff were very helpful, the restaurant was very good and reasonably priced, the fast free internet and complimentary coffee and cookies in the lobby were nice touches and of course, the location was brilliant.
