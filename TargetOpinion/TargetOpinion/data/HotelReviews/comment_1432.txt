Don't Stay Here!

Every single staff member we spoke with at Parc 55 were incredibly RUDE and unaccomodating. I was shocked at their behavior. In addition, the rooms were not clean, and are in need of renovation/refurbishing. I am a travel agent, so believe me when I say DO NOT stay at this hotel. You can find a much better SF hotel for the price (or less!) of a stay here, and you will avoid a very unpleasant experience.
