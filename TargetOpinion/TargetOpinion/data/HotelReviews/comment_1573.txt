Wonderful Hotel

We loved this hotel in downtown Seattle. The location was great--close to Pikes Market and great shopping. It was our first time in Seattle and we couldn't have picked a better place to stay. The room was spacious and spotless. The bedding heavenly--we were on the club level and we were pleasantly surprised at the great continental breakfast. I would definitely recommend this hotel.
