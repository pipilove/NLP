good value for money

We stayed here for 4 days on arrival in Sydney. Flight landed 6a.m. but can't check in till 2pm so this could be a problem for some. Luckily we could leave our cases at our son's flat. Check in was quick and painless - had booked from the UK and no problems with this. The room was large enough, as was the bathroom, although as other people have said, the whole bathroom floor gets wet when you use the shower as it is not in a cubicle, it just has a curtain. I liked the fact that there was an iron and ironing board available in the room. Towels were changed every day even if we had not left them on the floor which was meant to be the sign that you wanted them changed. The location of the hotel was good, close to Hyde Park and a pleasant walk to the city and harbour. All in all we felt it was good value for money - a clean and comfortable place to sleep after a long day's sigtseeing in Sydney.
