Great resonably priced hotel in Seattle

My husband and I stayed here during the first week of March. We needed to be in Seattle to handle some family matters, so this was an unexpected getaway.For the price, it was very clean, the kitchenette was a great amenity (fridge, sink, coffee maker), and close to attractions.We felt that the beds could use some updating. On both of the double beds, there was an indentation in the middle. So that made it a bit uncomfortable for sleeping. Otherwise, we would definitely stay here again on a return trip to Seattle.
