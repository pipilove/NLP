Uber Style, Super Service, Maxmum Comfort - did not want to leave!

I'll admit I'm a bit confused by the negative reviews of the W Seattle. I had nothing but positive experiences.The W Seattle caters to the hipster 26-35 crowd. Think running shoe designers, web moguls and fasion mavens. People wearing sunglasses in the elevators, that sort of thing. I guess that comes with the territory; the W certainly is trendy.The W is swathed in a somber, seriously cool style from the swank lounge to the luxurious rooms. The beds were plush and comfortable. The room felt like a modern apartment instead of a hotel. Accents abounded: stereo system, superior waffle robes, even a zen desk waterfall. The bathroom was stocked with luscious Bliss soaps.The staff was friendly and efficient. I was able to check in hours early with no issue. They replaced a lost room and bar key pleasantly, without charging for the loss as some hotels might.I skipped the bar. It was a bit too much of a 'scene' for my taste. If you enjoy the company of young beautiful people in the latest fashions you'll love it as the bar was thriving.One (minor) drawback was that the W is tucked within canyons of corporate high rises and there is little of interest in the immediate area. A 10-20 walk will take you to most of the tourist areas like Pioneer Square, Pike's Place Market, etc. however.Nonetheless, I'd stay there again. Amazing comfort.
