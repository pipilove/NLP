Its cheap for a reason!

Please only stay here if you want a very basic hotel thats quite close to all the sights, shopping etc. Be aware that your bed will be on wheels?!, the rooms are very basic ie the shower is a hole in the floor with a shower curtain so EVERYTHING gets wet. The restaurant has dirty crockery and the window ledges need cleaning. I think they also need to spend some money on soundproofing, you can hear doors slamming all hours of the day and night.On the plus side the staff are pleasant enough and are happy to book trips etc for you. We also got a good deal by booking online direct with them but I wouldnt want to pay full price.
