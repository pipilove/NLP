Nice Hotel Watch out for the Bed Bugs

The hotel itself is very nice. However, watch out for the bedbugs. We stayed in room 406 at the hotel on the 24-26th October 2008, when my Husband and I woke up on the Saturday morning we noticed that we had little lumps on our skin but did not understand why. When we woke up Sunday morning with more bites I put 2+2 together. I woke up with a bite on my eye lid, which hurt and itched like hell. A week later I still have the lump without the redness!Since then, I have had to spray my home and my bags with the clothes I took to make sure this does not spread into my home. Once you have bedbugs they are hard to shift. Until now I did not know they actually existed. Its AWFUL! I have yet to email the hotel and see what repsonse I get, however, if you do stay here I would suggest you check the bed first before opening your luggage. Other than that, its a nice hotel and a nice location. I hope you have better luck than me!
