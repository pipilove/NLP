Where did the 4 stars come from?

In a nutshell, clean and acceptable hotel, great location. No idea how they got their 4 stars, they have a lift, but no swimming pool, no sauna/steam room, the rooms are small, no tea or coffee facilities.Unfortunately, I booked this hotel with HOTELCLUB and they booked me a double room even though I stated that I had a 9 year old child. Anyway, I had to pay another 50 euros and HOTELCLUB doesn't want to know. If I knew about the additional charge, I think I would be rented an apartment instead since you would have more room and you can buy glorious fresh produce from the market and not pay for city priced meals at or around the hotel.
