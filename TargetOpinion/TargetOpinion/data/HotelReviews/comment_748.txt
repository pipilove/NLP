Ideal for a city break!

This hotel is ideal if you are on a weekend to Berlin and just need somewhere to put your head down at night. Although basic, the rooms are large and clean. The hotel staff are efficient and friendly, always happy to help you with directions etc. The breakfast in the hotel is excellent, offering a wide selection of hot and cold food. We particularly liked the waffle machine for making our own waffles! In the hotel reception there are a various leaflets for all the sights of Berlin, and the zoo is only a 5 minute walk away. It's about a 10 minute walk to zoo station where you can get a train to all the main sights in the east and only takes about 10 minutes. Around the hotel itself there are plenty of bars and restaurants and the department store Ka DeWe is just around the corner, as well as many many other shops, and they were setting up the Christmas market as we were leaving.
