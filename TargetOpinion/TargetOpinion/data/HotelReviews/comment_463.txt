Minimalist efficiency but no charm

Stayed for 2 nights to attend a conference in the hotel.The position is not great given that it is by the water as it is a long walk to the main areas of interest.A large modern hotel with no charm whatsoever. Efficient staff and restaurant good. Room was not large but acceptable. Bathroom clean but bath plug broken. Otherwise all OK and lots of hot water.My room on 2nd floor was quite noisy.....glazing didn't seem to cut out the noise from the outside.Fine for a business stay but not really ideal for tourists. It has no local charm and could be anywhere in the world. It is expensive and there are other better placed hotels giving better value.
