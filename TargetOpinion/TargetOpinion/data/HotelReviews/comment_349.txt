High tech nice hotel

We stayed here for 2 nights waiting for our cruise ship embarkation. The lobby is pretty and the room (deluxe double) had a nice view of the beach, was very high tech with automatic blinds, music throughout the room and a beautiful modern bathroom. Decor was neutral, and attractive. We arrived from the airport at 10 in the morning and had to wait until 3:00 for our room to be ready. This is our only complaint. Eventhough check out was noon. They had a nice welcome lounge with free food and drinks and we were given a nice tour of the amazing spa (didn't use it) and access to the pool and changerooms. The art/sculptures throughout were attractive. We paid less than 300 euros/night for the room which was reasonable. There was one 15 metre pool (nice large hammocks and loung chairs surrounding it) as well as a smaller almost like a wading pool. The atmosphere was relaxing with green apples and bottles of water available at the pool. We had to wait for a lounge chair in the shade one day. The food was excellent especially the buffet breakfast. Nicely presented and huge selection including asian choices for breakfast. It was near the beach and many restaurants and not too far from shopping (short taxi ride). Staff were very helpful although the front desk was a little snooty. The concierge were helpful in suggesting restaurants and calling for us. They have greeters who show you to your room and how to use things in your room. It was a nice touch. We enjoyed ourselves and if we went to Barcelona again we would stay here.
