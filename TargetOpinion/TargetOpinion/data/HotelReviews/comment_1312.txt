Omni shmomni...

My family and I visited S.F. 12/27-12/30 and stayed at the Omni. We requested a roll-a-way bed and were given an inflatable bed. We stayed in the signature room which was suposed to have upgraded furnishings and amenities (for an upgraded price). I called the hotel directly three times to confirm and to make sure our requests of a king bed and roll-a-way bed were received. We thought it might be cleaner than the deluxe  room we stayed in on a previous visit. It was not. The carpet was stained in several places and the furniture needs refurbishing. The light fixtures in the bathroom were still caked with dust.The mgr. could not understand why an inflatable bed was unaccepatble, but moved us to a mini suite after much effort(two hours of back and forth-you know). This room was long and narrow with one small window. It was dirty and dreary and had a bowl of rotten fruit in a silver bowl waiting for us. The bathroom was even worse. It had no tub,just a huge, mildewed and cracked shower with a weird wooden bench and bars everywhere. When I called the mgr. to tell her this was not ok she told me this was the handicap suite and all she had. It did have a kingsize sofa bed in it with dirty, musty linens on it. We took this over the inflatable bed but we were not happy.The doormen are very aggressive and have never turned down a tip for us..Also, do not join select guest. I did and I also called them to confirm our reservation and got nothing that I could see. I think there have been some fake reviews here...Hmm...
