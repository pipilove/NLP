a disaster

Arrived at the reception with a party of 12 to find that the reservations had not been processed and our rooms were not ready ,this was at 1400 were then told to come back in four hours..not good so far .On returning to the hotel to be told the reception did not know if the rooms were ready. this was a lie we kew this because a member of our party is involved with the hotel industry and he spotted the unprocessed checkin documents on the reception desk..! we had to wait another two hours befor we were even told what was going on. reception was a mess. when the manager was asked for the receptionist was sent out and was very rude and unhelpful in the mater. While we all found the staff in general very nice and helpful. reception and management was arrogant and rude i could not recomend this hotel as a good place to stay in berlin. In my opinion this hotel did not give me the four star experience i had paid for and left berlin very dissapointed.
