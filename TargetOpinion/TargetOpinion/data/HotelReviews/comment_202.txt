Nadia Hotel - Faultless

stay I engaged in a considerable amount of research to find somewhere to stay in Amsterdam for a recent weekend in mid December. After reading the reviews, I settled for the Nadia Hotel. It is sometimes an all too often occurrence that people's expectations of some establishments are so high after reading a long tail of positive feedback, that even the slightest issue has a considerable impact on their perceptions of the place. However, the Nadia Hotel was absolutely faultless. Little touches like a free welcome drink and continental breakfast really do make a difference. The staff are excellent - all very friendly and eager to help in anyway they can. A good example is when I returned back late on my first night and mentioned that I couldn't get hold of any beers. Within five minutes there was a knock on my door with one of the guy's holding a couple of cans - which he proclaimed were on the house. The rooms, in typical Amsterdam style for establishments this size, are small. I opted for a single room with balcony, overlooking the bustling Raadhuisstraat. The lack of double glazing does mean the noise of traffic (particularly the trams), permeates into the room - but it is hardly a sleep killer!Rooms have TV, electronic safe, small fridge and tea/coffee making facilities. The bathroom is very small - yet adequate. Security is good, with a 24hr manned intercom secuity system, and older travellers ought to beware of the extremely steep steps that lead up to the reception and rooms. The location is, in my opinion, excellent. Less than 15 minutes walk from Centraal Station, or a mere 5 minutes from Dam Square - the hotel is ideally located for visitng the major sights of the city. The Nadia Hotel is an excellent choice for the single traveller who prefers the cosy atmosphere of a small hotel, and I will definitely be booking again when I visit the city again.
