Great location

 The hotel's website annoyed me because the headline rate only applied to the first night, with subsequent nights going up in price. It also had a 'bargain basement' feel about it. In fact, if it were not that our friends had already booked into the hotel, I would have gone elsewhere. Therefore, when we arrived, we were pleasantly surprised to find a much more upmarket establishment than the website suggested. The room and ensuite bathroom were both fine and well-appointed. Our only complaint was that, even though the heating was off, it was terribly hot. Our friends found the same in their room. The staff were friendly, helpful and spoke good English. The location is excellent (the Latin Quarter) with good cafes nearby and good transport links.
