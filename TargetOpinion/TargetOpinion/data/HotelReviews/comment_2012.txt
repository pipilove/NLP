Great value for the price

I was a bit worried when I booked - I needed somewhere to stay for a week and thought Id made a mistake staying in a Travelodge. However, from the moment I arrived I was impressed. I asked to stay on the top floor as the reviews on here said it was noisy lower down. So I was put on the 18th floor. The room was small, but spotlessly clean, modern and quite well designed. The bathroom was very clean and quite cleverly arranged. One review said water went everywhere, but we didnt have this problem. The kitchenette was useful - but you really cant cook anything substantial here - it is tiny. The lifts were quick, staff really helpful, the room didnt seem to be cleaned every day but we didnt mind too much. The location is great. 5 min walk to Hyde Park and near some good restaurants. nly slight bit of ad vice - we were put in room next to the lifts and the doors arent very soundproofed. We were awoken a few times by people coming out of the lifts. Id ask to be placed along the corridoors. Minor problem though. Would definately stay here again if I got a good deal. We paid 99 AUD a night!
