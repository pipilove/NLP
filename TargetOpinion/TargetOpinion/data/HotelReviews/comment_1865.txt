Great hotel in a superb location

Just returned from spending 4 nights at this hotel. Had to upgrade our room to obtain the harbour and opera house view, but this was well worth it.The room was quite large, with 2 double beds, as we had our 2 children with us.The only disappointing feature was another taller building in front of the hotel which spoilt the full view of the harbour and the bridge.The swimming pool was a little bit small for the size of the hotel.The staff were very friendly, and even took care of our luggage as soon as we stepped out of the taxi.Breakfast in the hotel is a bit pricey at $25 but this included everything from the cold and hot menus.The hotel is in a very good location with 5 minutes to Circular Quay for all the ferries and cruises. Some good restaurants nearby, and the City Centre about 20 mins walk.The icing on the cake was our departure from the hotel to the airport. We called for a taxi at the front of the hotel, but instead got a limousine service from the concierge as we had 4 suitcases plus hand luggage.
