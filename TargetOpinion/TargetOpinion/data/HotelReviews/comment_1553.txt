Great location, Great price

We stayed at the Moore for two nights right after Memorial Day, in a standard room with 2 double beds and a private bath on the 7th floor (719). The room was huge, while sparsely decorated. The bathroom was average - small, and there was a large walk-in closet. There was no air conditioning, but that seems to be the norm in Seattle. The room was very clean - we could smell the cleaning supplies when we entered the room. The front desk service was great - they recommended great places to eat, order delivery, and get a shuttle to the airport. The free internet terminal in the lobby was also appreciated.The location is great - not only is it walkable to many attractions, but it's in the middle of the downtown free bus zone, so you don't have to walk if you don't want to.Our room was approximately $100 with tax per night. I'd stay there again.
