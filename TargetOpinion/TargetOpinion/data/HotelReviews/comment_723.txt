Good Location

We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights on a quick trip to Berlin. We were on the 26th floor and had a room looking towards all the major sites in Berlin, the view was fantastic.The hotel is very easy to get to from the airports. We landed at Tegal and caught the TXL bus straight to Alexanderplatz - fantastic value at 2.10EURO. If you have a day pass, this trip is included in it.Rooms are not huge and as mentioned the shower and the toliet are in little glass cubes, rather than in one separate bathroom. The room has a minibar and small fridge.Check in and check out was fast and friendly. We didn't use any of the other facilities at the hotel.
