Honeymoon in Paris

We have just spent 5 nights in Paris on our honeymoon in The Terrass Hotel in Paris. We would highly recommend this hotel and suggest if going there on a special occasion worth upgrading to a superior room. The staff and service was first class and the location of the hotel is just perfect. Elaine  Barrie Alexander, Scotland
