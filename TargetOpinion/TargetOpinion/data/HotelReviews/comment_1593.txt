Nice Room, Great Location

We stayed at the Sheraton for two nights after our Alaskan cruise. We found a nice big room, with a comfortable bed, new linens, very clean and modern bathroom. No noise from the construction. Maybe because it was on a weekend, but we found the hotel very quiet for its size and the crowd that always seemed to be coming and going in the lobby.Good location for shopping. Easy access to highways. Easy walk from Pike's market. Would stay here again.
