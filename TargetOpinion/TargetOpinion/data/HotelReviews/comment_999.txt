Beware of your belongings

I chose to stay at the Renaissance based on the reviews I had read on this site, but I really regret my decision. First, the room was very small, and, although I had used Marriott points, I still had to pay an extra 70 euros/night for an upgrade(?). Next, although it was very clear that there were 2 of us staying in the room, housekeeping continually left only 1 chocolate  when asked for another, said they didn't have any more. I realize the chocolate thing is not that big of a deal, but it was a disappointment. Also, one reviewer had raved about the shower, which I thought was awful. It was a small square stall that smelled of mold/mildew, and the water pressure  temperature both varied throughout a shower. The worst thing, though, was when we were packing to leave, my daughter realized her stuffed dog was missing! She is 18 now, but has had that dog since she was about 3  has taken him on every trip we have ever taken. The front desk assured us that it must have been taken with the sheets, they would contact the laundry service, and we would of course get the dog back. Since returning home, we are now told by phone that chances are very bad that he'll be returned. Ironically, part of the reason I chose this hotel vs. the Marriott Champs Elysses was that, 4 years ago, when we stayed at the Marriott, my sunglasses were taken. I will admit that the hotel is in a good (but quiet)location and the staff (other than at least one housekeeper) is pleasant, but watch out for extra charges and keep all of your belongings locked up!!!!
