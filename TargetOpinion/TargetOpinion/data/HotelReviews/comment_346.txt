Great showers, nice room, average hotel

We stayed at the Arts for a long weekend having attended a conference at the hotel.Rooms are wonderful - large, well finished with the usual extras (BO TVs, etc) and they have particularly nice the bathrooms - the shower was one of the best I have had in a hotel - really excellent.However the hotel has a peculiar layout and the reception and public areas felt cramped. Oftentimes it had the feeling of a train station...There are 6 lifts going up to the bedrooms however the wait for the lifts was very long - It was frustrating waiting on lifts and the infrequency of them meant that every time I used them they were packed full of people - making the short journey pretty unpleasant...The hotel is near the Marina, which is great if you want to be near the beach, but is not in the centre of things... If you want to see the sights and sounds of Barcelona there are more central hotels.
