The perfect spot away from the crowds

M and C from San Mateo, CAWe just returned from a 5-night stay at the Hotel Fita in Amsterdam. The location, near the Van Gogh Museum (quiet, safe, on public transportation), the helpful owners and hotel staff, the breakfast buffet with fresh squeezed orange juice and all the other perks (free international calls, free internet, free laundry service, small but serviceable elevator) made this a perfect choice. If you choose a smaller room, Hans will store your luggage. We would stay here again and will recommend it to our friends!
