What a great find!

This was the perfect hotel for us. We had a superior room on the top floor, which was quite big and had a big bathroom. Housekeeping did an excellent job. The front desk staff were always friendly and helpful.The location really is ideal. Lots of options for food and drinks around, the Champ du Mars is a few blocks away for a picnic, and the Metro stop is very close. You really can't ask for a better hotel in Paris!
