J'aime beaucoup l&quot;Hotel des Grands Hommes

The hotel location is great - a short walk down the street to the Metro, Blvd St.Michel, Luxembourg Gardens. My room, although small, was beautifully appointed and fit my needs very well. I would definitely return for another stay, and would not hesitate to recommend the hotel to friends.
