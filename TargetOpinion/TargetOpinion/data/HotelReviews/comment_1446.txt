Acceptable accomodations in a great location

After making reservations many months ago for very specific room requirements (we needed three no-smoking rooms, two that adjoined, another for a handicapped room) -- and having confirmed these reservations the day before arriving -- the hotel had no knowledge of the arrangements. After a lengthy delay at the front desk at check in, we had could not get the adjoining room for my children. The rooms were acceptable, nothing fancy but comfortable and clean and decently appointed. When we called for feather pillows we were told all the rooms had them. But ours didn't.r A note on the lobby: this is a oddly shaped place, fairly long and narrow, the front desk at the far end, and coldly decorated. The breakfasts that were included featured a good buffet that we thought met our needs. You could also order from a menu. Food isn't luxury, but was fairly decent. The real positive of the Renaissance Parc 55 is the location: right near the shopping along Market Street, a couple of blocks from Union Square (more higher-end shopping), and just a block or so from the first (or last) stop on the trolley. After the initial screw-up upon arrival, we thought this hotel was terrific for our family's needs.
