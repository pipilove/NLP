Nice view, Nice accomodations

Having never been to Seattle, I am pleased with the Warwick and my stay there. The staff was amicable and fast--there were always at least 3 people at the front desk. The lobby also has a nice lounge area with a fireplace. They also have a business center with 2 computers with internet access and a printer (free use of all when I was there). My only complaint is the jaccuzi was out of service and being worked on in the pool area (which is in the basement), and the construction zone atmosphere down there was unpleasant. Room service and the food was excellent and fast.If you book a room, ask for a space needle view--I stayed on the 6th floor in a corner room and had a nice view. Plus, it was fairly quiet and I never heard noise (i.e. someone else's loud TV) except for the occasional bus route on the street below. If you don't mind walking, you are only a couple blocks from Westlake shopping center and a few blocks from Pike's Marketplace. Across the street is a gourmet market--Ralph's--that stays open 'till midnight, and a bakery called Dahlia's--known for their coconut cream pie.And best of all, I booked this room on Expedia for a mere $105/night. You won't be smack in the center of everything, but a little walking will get you to the main tourist spots. I felt relaxed and comfortable there--I recommend it.
