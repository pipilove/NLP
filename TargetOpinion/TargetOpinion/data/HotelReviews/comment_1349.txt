Lovely place to stay

This was the first stop on our road trip of California.This hotel was very impressive - from the staff at the front door to the free wine tasting sessions.The rooms were very quirky - the theme making the room a lot more interesting. The rooms were also quite big.On the first night we ate in the restaurant in the hotel and they were very friendly and helped explain the menu to us.The only thing that very a bit too expensive was the valet car parking as the hotel is right on the fishermans warff.Also - whilst having a room with a view may be nice - the fogg is soooooo dense that you might not even see the bridge at all.We cycled to the bridge and didn't see it until we were almost on it. When we went over the bridge we couldn't see anything!If you can afford to stay here then do. you won't regret it.Becks
