Good Service and Location

We arrived at about noon on Saturday the 3rd of September and were checked in to our room within ten minutes, a big plus as I had traveled from Los Angeles and just wanted to get some sleep. As noted in other reviews when you close the drapes the rooms are very dark and their is no clock. I for one was happy to have a room I could make dark enough to get some sleep in in the middle of the day and did not care what time it was. The room was nicely appointed and very quite. We had room service that evening, from Pixio(sp?), which was both delivered quickly and very very good - in fact so good that we had dinner at their once during our stay.I found the staff very helpful and friendly and did not experence any delays in getting the room cleaned as had been noted by others. Like other I had a problem with the shower and got some water on the floor during my first attempt but did not find it hard to adjust two and found the water pressure and temperture controls to be fine. If you have stayed in a Sofitel or other european chain you will know doubt be a master of this type of shower and in any case it is not hard to keep water in the tub once you get us to it.The only problem I experenced was getting to the hotel, our cab driver seem confused and while we got to the right street he insisted the hotel was located a block before its acutal location. Apparently this is a common problem as the hotel staff saw us coming and rushed to help with the bags.I was highly pleased with both the hotel and Pixio and recomend both though I would say that this hotel would be best for business travelers and couples. I would also print of a detailed map of the location.
