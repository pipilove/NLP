Great Location

You can get a RER train from CDG airport stops at Luxembourg Gardens which is a 5 minute walk way from the hotel. Stade de France is also on the same line which makes the hotel a good location if going to a 6 Nations game. Hotel is also walking distance to Notre Dame. We booked the hotel based on the reviews on the trip advisor and were not disappointed. We asked and got a room with a balcony  view over the pantheon which was excellent. Would stay here again on our next visit Paris.
