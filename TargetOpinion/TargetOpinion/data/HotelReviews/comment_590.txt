Great rooftop pool

What a superb hotel, lived up to our expectations. Every amenity you could wish for, lovely spa pool downstairs, bar, restaurant and the icing on the cake the rooftop pool. Much to my delight I was told when we checked in that the rooftop pool was heated. Being rather a fan of rooftop pools I'd been looking for a heated one for our stay in January, but couldn't find much detail on websites. Yes, the bar was a bit expensive, but this is the best hotel (in my opinion) on La Rambla, right in the heart of things. The breakfast was excellent, but try and track down a BB rate.Overall I am a tough customer to please, but I couldn't find fault with anything, apart from having to come home!
