Noisy + Rude does not equal good hotel

Stayed in August 2004 for 6 nights too many. After the first night when we could hear EVERYTHING in the adjacent rooms from normal talking to laughing and from in-room movies to neighbor's bathroom visists, we should have left. Second night was the worst as there was a party in the next room from about 11:00 pm - 1:30 am. The staff did not think the noise level was anything to complain about and told us such. Additionally, the front desk was less then friendly when we cashed traveler's checks, even though they said it was policy to cash them. And to top off, the doormen seemed to think it wasn't their duty to hold open doors or greet patrons. I vacation at least one week a year in San Francisco, and I would NEVER stay at this hotel again.
