Have to disagree somewhat

Just to balanace the previous reviews which have all been great i have some negative points .I stayed there recently -I had booked a twin room over 3 months before hand .One of the reviewers mentioned their single room was a bit cell like, well i wonder whether they had just added a second bed in the single room !It was about 2.5 to 3 metres wide and then the length of 2 single beds long -i suppose about 5 -6 metres long . Bigger than a cabin but sort of the same feeling The beds were along the side of the wall so careful positioning needed to avoid sleeping with room mates feet wafting into my face. Nice The duvets were very thin but there was good heat in the room so they were sufficient except I was by the radiator and my room mate was furthest away so a bit of messing with keeping it warm /cool enough over the stay. The pillow was like a smaller sheet of the duvet which you folded up to bulk up -didnt bother me but if you are a fluffy pillow person you may be dissappointed . We asked for non smoking but it didnt seem to be one -ashtray in the room and smell of smoke every morning from the corridor. The other problem I had was I found it quite loud - I couldnt hear anything form the rooms beside us but the noise from the corridor reminded me of a hostel-i dont think the people were very loud just general noise seemed to come through.Otherwise the hotel was very clean which was good-towels changed every day and nice staff etc.Breakfast was good and the price was very reasonable -It did O.K. and I know they probably have some very nice rooms with none of these problems. Unfortunately I didnt get one and just letting you know in case you would be a bit dissapointed too based on previous reviews
