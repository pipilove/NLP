Great Location!!!

This is just a great hotel all around! To start the rooms are ultra-modern and very large, especially for European hotels. Very new and clean. The location is unbeatable. It is right in the middle of the Damsquare within walking distance of the Centraal Station. In the area there are numerous restaraunts and places to shop. Shopping can range from high end to simple souvenirs. You are also a couple blocks away from the red light district and many museums. The hotel has air conditioning and a free internet lounge. The staff is very helpful. You will not want to leave this hotel!!!
