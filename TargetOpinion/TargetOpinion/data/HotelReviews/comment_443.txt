Loved the Monte Carlo

We stayed at the Monte Carlo for 3 nights prior to boarding a cruise ship on November 16.We found the service to be excellent- front desk staff very helpful in pointing out the best way to tour Barcelona. The room was spacious, clean, and comfortable. We had a sitting room as well as a balcony overlooking Las Rambla. Because of the double doors on the balcony, the room was quiet.The buffet breakfast contained a lot of food but not all to our tastes. It was convenient, as we found no other full breakfast restaurants in the area.The free use of the computer in the hotel lobby was a nice surprise.We would definitely book at this hotel again!
