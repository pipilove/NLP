Only book this hotel if you can't find anything else.!!!

Huge Disappoinment. Only good point is the location.My husband and I travel quite extensivley and honestly, for a 5 star hotel, I can think of better hotels. The room was very average. Hotel lobby looked somewhat tacky.Staff overall very unhelpful and really not that interested. We had to change rooms, dirty bathroom, loud buzz on the Ac vent and a VERY noisy sound from constant water running through the wall. In all fairness we were offered a different room but it was so late at night that we opted to do this in the morning.Changed rooms: We found a noisy Ac fan (surprise surprise) closet door would not close, which meant the light would not turn off. The grill in the bathroom door was lose and kept falling out with a loud bang everytime you opened or closed the door.Service technican did come Fan was fixed, closet door was somewhat fixed, grill was never fixed. As we only had 2 days there we couldn't be bothered anymore. This hotel really needs to be rated down, we have had better rooms, better service, friendlier staff in a 3 star hotel,there is no way this hotel deserves to be rated as a 5 star.
