The maneger was a jerk !

At the time we reserved the roomsin July,2007, we had requested an early check in, if possible. I had reserved 3 rooms for 5 nights for three of my employees,my wife and myself. Upon arrival at 1:30 two of the rooms were not ready . Despite travelling all day we took the opportunity to sightsee for a couple of hours. The check in desk assured me that they would be ready no later than 3:00. When we returned at 3:30,the rooms were still not ready but we were assured that they would be ready shortly. So we waited and waited. At 4:30 the second room was ready and the third room was ready at 4:55. I thought the wait was excessive and I asked to speak to the manager to register my concerns. The general manager promptly arrived and told me he was sorry for the wait. However, when I tried to get a word in during the 2+ minute conversation(?) the guy kept talking and talking, never letting me express my complaint. Finally, fed up with this, I held up both hand and said fine, I'll go to my room. Sensing my irritation,he offered to buy me a beer! A BEER ! So much for customer relations . At the Chancellor Hotel it seems to stop at saying I'm sorry. The staff especially Harris and Rory were excellent. GRF
