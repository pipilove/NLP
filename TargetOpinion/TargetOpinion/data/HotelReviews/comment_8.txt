They mean well . . .

I had some reservations about booking with the Pulitzer after reading the mixed reviews but was talked into it by my travel agent who books high end travel. I must say it is in a good location and one of the nicer hotels in Amsterdam. The bathrooms are small but like every one else said are nicely done and meet all the needs. Both the rooms I stayed in were well appointed and fine for a nice holiday room. However, we did have several issues. We were woken up by a mouse scratching at the door trying to get out of our room. Needless to say we were immediately moved to an upgraded room with a view of the canals only to find out the mini bar was broken and never able to be fixed during our stay. Also the mini bar is electronic and make mistakes at the slightest jiggle The buffet breakfast was included with our package but would have been 25 euro each if not included- which is way too high.It is one of the nicest hotels for Amsterdam but I can see where it gets spotty reviews. If you catch them right your in a 4 star hotel - if not -your going to get pot luck on some services. The hard part is that is a far better hotel than most amsterdam hotels so..... the question is what are your compromises.
