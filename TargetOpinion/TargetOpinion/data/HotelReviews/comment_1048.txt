Careful

Unfortunately, the booking practice of this hotel appears to be deceptive. A few days ago I was offered a last minute rate which I accepted and furnished my credit card details within the period required by the hotel. Their response was they were sorry but the room had already been rented. We all know that the hotels will hold aroom for a definite period pending receipt of credit card details so there was no mistake. Obviously, they found someone to rent at the normal rate. I am sure the hotel is lovely but the traveler needs to be careful in dealing with them. This is an issue of honesty. My wifehad warned me to look elsewhere after reading the recent report on Tripadvisor of items being stolen from a room at night. I should havelistened. I am sure the manager will reply with his explanation of the mistake. This was not a mistake! Shame, shame!!
