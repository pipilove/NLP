Great Hotel and Location

Great Hotel very central for sightseeing. We booked a club room thinking it would be big, but it was quite small compared to other places we stayed in. Everything was great except for breakfast, which is served in the club lounge on the top floor(great view), but unless you are early it's a bit of a bun fight and the quality was not great. The canapes and desserts offered at other times of the day as part of the package were great.
