great deal, great hotel, great location

Very nice four-star hotel only a few blocks from the popular Las Ramblas road. Friendly  courteous staff, all English speaking. Room and bathroom were huge by European standards. Had Sky satellite televsion. A bit noisy if you have a street-side room, but with the windows closed the noise is well insulated. Very close to subway stop. A great choice at any price, but was an especially good value with the rate we got. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
