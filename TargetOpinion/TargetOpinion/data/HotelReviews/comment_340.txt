For a 5 star hotel where the official ranking does not go above 4, must do bette

we were pleasantly surpised by this hotel - for a relatively cheap package deal we were expecting a lot, lot worse. Location was fantastic, rooftop bar and pool lovely (albeit expensive!) . Slightly annoying were the lifts that wouldn't take you up there at 11pm, despite the bar being open until 1.30am!I agree with other reviewers though that turn-down service and cleaning of rooms was erratic. Can't comment on the breakfast or the other facilities on the hotel as we didn't really make use of them. A big problem was the beds. Although very comfortable indeed, two small beds pushed together does not a romantic holiday make.
