great location, lovely staff

Excellent location (in the lovely Jordaan district) and very friendly and obliging staff. The room was v. small but fine for my needs and had been recently refurbished. Breakfast was good, although the breakfast room was quite cramped. As with many Amsterdam Hotels - there is a steep staircase and lots of steps! But I would certainly recommend the Hotel Nadia
