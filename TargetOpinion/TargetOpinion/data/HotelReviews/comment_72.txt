Krass Krasnapolsky!

This was a most imposing hotel. It was spacious and quite grand. However, we found the service to be very sub-standard to the point of rudness. On return we complained and, eventually, received a written apology along with the 2-night voucher - for the same hotel! Worse, we had to use the voucher within a very short period. Did we return here - no chance!!
