Basic and disappointing

Basic and disappointing. The photo is misleading, we thought. The layout is unattractive, as the car-park is the whole ground-floor and also serves as the entrance! The reception is a tiny office and the rooms are on narrow internal balconies overlooking the centre of the carpark. We could not understand glowing reviews by earlier visitors. Staff at the front-desk were quite friendly but when the toilet became blocked the room staff did not hurry to help. Breakfast was awful. At least it was quite clean, and it does seem hard to get a moderately priced place in SanFrancisco in Summer. It is near to the overrated cablecars, and we enjoyed a boat trip in the harbour (but watch out for sunburn even in the mist). We would try somewhere else if there is a next time in San Francisco.
