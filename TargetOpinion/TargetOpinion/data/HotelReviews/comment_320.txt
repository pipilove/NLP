Great hotel in central Barcelona

Have just returned from a great 3 night stay at this hotel. We had a tripple room with 2 twins and a great sofa bed. The room was quite large and very clean. The staff were very helpfull and the breakfast which was included at a great rate was good.The location is great.All in all agreat hotel - would definately stay again.
