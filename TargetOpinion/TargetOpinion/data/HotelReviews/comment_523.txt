We stayed for 3 nights at the Hotel Pulitzer with our two sons. The rooms are quite small and minimally furnished -- for example, there isn't a stand-alone desk, rather, a fold out work station. The tv is tiny. There are no tissues in the bathroom -- you have to call housekeeping to bring you small packets. And if you want some ice, you have to pay a service charge to have it delivered or go to the bar to get it yourself! Pretty unbelievable for a supposedly 4 star hotel. The staff were nice although their English wasn't very good. On the positive side, the hotel is very well located and has free internet service.
