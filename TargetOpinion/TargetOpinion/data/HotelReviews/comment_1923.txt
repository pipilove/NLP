Tired and pretty ordinary

Check in was quick,easy and efficient but thats about where it stops.Don't be fooled by the Four Seasons name. This is a long way off its 5 star competitors in Sydney and I've stayed at quite a few.The rooms are very small and need serious updating. The TV is old with bad reception.The bathroom is even smaller.The room we stayed in had airconditioning problems. On my 4th call to management I demanded a room change. I received one.My recent review of the Shangri La encompassess everything that this hotel is not - quality.Pretentious exteriors does NOT make a 5 star hotel.Spend your money elsewhere.
