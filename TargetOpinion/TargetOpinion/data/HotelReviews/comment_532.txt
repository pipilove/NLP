Loved the Jazz

Can't beat the Hotel Jazz for location! Just a few minutes walk to almost anywhere you want to be. The rooms are very clean and comfortable - shockingly quiet given activity on the streets below. Like others mentioned, I would have liked a shower curtain to keep the water contained but not that big of an issue. Only issue we had was temp of the room: It was pretty warm and we couldn't get the air to kick in... meant we had to open the balcony door and hear all of the noise below...Small consequence for great place!
