Great Location

We stayed three nights in January. The room was somewhat small; however, we had a choice in the category of a suite or a room facing the Passeig de Gracia, and we opted for the view. We made the right choice, as the room had french doors to a small patio with a tremendous view. Everything else about the room was good - clean, nice bathroom, etc. We were only there a few nights, and who spends a lot of time in the room? Our reservation did not include breakfast, but there are plenty of options close by. There is a coffee/pastry house just across the street. The location was terrific - close to public transportation, shops, restaurants, etc. Service in the hotel was good, with easily-available advise which was appreciated. Good dinner options around. I would recommend Costa Gallega, one block north on the Passeig de Gracia (get the piquillo peppers stuffed with crabmeat, patatas bravas, and wash down with a good cold glass of the local Penedes wine - Vina Sol. Very reasonable. Oh yes, I forgot, the beds were about the most comfortable we ever slept in. I would definitely recommend this hotel.
