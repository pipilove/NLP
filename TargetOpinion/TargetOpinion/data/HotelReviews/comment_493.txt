Waste of money!

 We are, in fact STILL here. We cannot wait to check out! Here麓s the scoop. The hotel itself is clean, modern and the rooms are spacious. That麓s as good as it gets. I booked my reservations through a travel agent in Scottsdale, Arizona and well, I should have done it myself because it would have been about the tenth of the cost and maybe it wouldn't suck so much....Fisrt of all, if you speak English, they have people who speakit rather well. HOWEVER -- the people who work here do not like Brits, Americans, etc and will automatically give you the crappiest room available. Our room (along with any other English speaking patron) gets the WORST view amaginable. OVER THE CONSTRUCTION DUMP! We are on the tenth floor and haven麓t slept a wink. The walls are paper thin, the windows might as well be open -- it麓s THAT loud. There are teenage skaters all over the front of the hotel and they are dirty and they WILL steal your wallet! The person next to us had his taken out of his pocket!This hotel is SO far away from everything -- unless you have business to do right around here, you ar wasting your money staying here. You will spend the majority of your time on the train. Forget staying out late becuase the trains don麓t run past midnight -- however, everything starts after midnight! The area the hotel is in is dirty, and very poor area of town. There is NOTHING to do hee and it wil take FOREVER to get to where you want to go. If I could give you one piece of advice -- either pay more for a hotel closer to where you will actually be doing things, or come back at another time. Staying in this part of town is an absolute complete waste of money.
