Poor Service

Booked at this hotle over a month in advance. Upon arrival was informed that our room was unavailable - 'there was a problem'. We were transferred to another hotel having been told that there has been an issue with their computer (and that 25 other people were also affected). Substitute hotel was poorly located for us and, as a consequence, our first break to Berlin was ruined. Staff at the Alex Plaza were unhelpful and had a 'couldn't care less' attitude. We got the strong impression that 'tourists' were very much secondary to 'business' guests. Very disappointed.
