Great Location

I would say that the big plus for this hotel is its location. It is close to the Museum Plein with the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh Museum, and boat trips around the city start just across the road. There are plenty of restaurants nearby including the Hard Rock Cafe just across the canal. The city centre is a short walk away along a pedestrianised street or you can take a tram.The hotel has been partly refurbished and the rooms we staying in were very modern but on the small side. The rooms didn't have a separate bathroom; instead there was a partition with the wash basin, toilet cubicle and shower cubicle.The staff were friendly and helpful, and the bar service was good. It's not the best hotel in Amsterdam but overall it's good value, and I'd probably go there again.
