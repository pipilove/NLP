SMALL rooms, no wifi but business center great

A king-size bed in a small room made it difficult to place luggage and still be able to walk around. The bathroom WAS small and the separate wash basin with no counter next to it made the small glass shelf above inadequate. We have been in much worse especially in London so it was no big deal. We made a joke out of the logistics. It was clean. The additional charge for the wifi in the room was a turn-off but they had a virtually unknown business center room behind the lobby which offered two computers and a printer for free. The location is fine. I believe the pricing is too high for what is offered (I don't like paying for artwork and original designs). The staff was friendly and helpful.
