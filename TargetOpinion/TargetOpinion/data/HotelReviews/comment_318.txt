All style and no substance.

I stayed in the Majestic with my boyfriend in mid-December and the hotel is beautiful and very centrally located to the Passeg de Gracia metro stop. The metro is very easy to use once you get the hang of it and we bought a 10 journey travel card with our debit card and once I had used it to go through the barrier I passed it to my boyfriend to use and it was so easy. Now the hotel itself-beautiful lobby and clean although we found the general atmosphere a bit formal and stuffy for 2 young people in our 20's and this alone would put us off returning again. We would stay in a more relaxed,welcoming hotel in future. There are no tea+coffee making facilities in the room which I have had in all hotels in various cities I have stayed in before and was a big disappointment considering the rates the hotel charges. We were in a room which must have been the smallest room I have ever stayed in you literally walked 3 paces from the bed and were in the bathroom. It was clean and comfortable but far too small for the rates they charge. The minibar as expected was absolutely extortionate and if you go to a supermarket on the Ramblas called Carrefour you can stock up on the same brand of water the hotel puts in the minibar. Hotel cost per bottle-4 euro carrefour cost-21 cents. You do the maths. I feel with this hotel you are simply paying for the name.
