Great Hotel...  

Stayed here for a couple of nights on the way back from Ibiza. Great room, we had a 'Designo' double as there were no suites availble, but the r0om was excellent, as were the desk staff. No bar as such in the hotel but it's right on the Ramblas so this isn't really an issue. Only (very slight) blight on the two nights was the grumpy little fellow who brought our wine to the room!
