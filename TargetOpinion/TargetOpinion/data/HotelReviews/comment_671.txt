Stay away...

I have just returned from a weekend in Berlin, where I stayed at the Berlin Mark Hotel.The best thing about this hotel is the location: around the corner from the Kurfurstendam, in central Berlin, and close to lots of public transport. Also, getting taxis from hotel never took more than 3 minutes when the hotel called, which was rather impressive.The hotel is very basic and the room I was given had a single bed (I haven't seen this in hotels for years!) and was smaller than most student accommodation I have seen! The room was extremely basic and the bed and pillow were far too soft, which made me have a terrible time sleeping. I was also given a smoking room. I don't recall Expedia (with whom I booked) asking if I wanted a smoking or non-smoking room, so I felt I didn't have arguments to change. When I asked for a non-smoking room I was told they were fully booked and I couldn't change. Fair enough, but I think there is only one floor in the whole building (of 7 floors) that is non-smoking, so be aware of that when booking.The staff are helpful and nice but the whole place is in serious need of a refurbishment. The decor is very early 80s with some nauseating bright green everywhere... It was also strange to be handed a key, rather than a card for the room, but I suppose that is just me.Brekfast is plentiful but very basic. Beware of smoking areas for people having breakfast that are very close to non-smoking. In fact, the hotel reeked of cigarettes.In other words, if you don't mind the comfort of your bed and if you are a smoker, you will love it! If not, stay away. There are plenty of hotels to choose from in the area.
