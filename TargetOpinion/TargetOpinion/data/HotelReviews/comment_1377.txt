Good location - and that's it

A complete disappointment - from losing the reservation made through Best Western toll-free number (our computer crashed when receiving reservations from BW - lame) to charging our credit card for someone elses stay 3 WEEKS AFTER WE LEFT! There appears to be no management actively involved with running this dump, cause when we asked to speak with one the front desk staff got very nervous and suddenly worked hard to find our lost reservation. Dont let the free wine and biscotti fool you. There is a Holiday Inn Express exactly one block away.
