Not bad, but not great either. The hotel is right on top of a underground stop, which makes it easy to get to/from, but otherwise the location is nothing special: on a busy road and with nothing much immediately nearby. The rooms are clean and modern, and the facilities ok - the pool, though small, is pleasant; the bar lacks character and atmosphere and the breakfast doesn't really rise above standard Eurofare, though if you just need some fuel for the day ahead it'll do.Our major gripe is the room we were initially checked into: it was like a cell. There was no natural light at all, the only 'window' was a small opaque whitewashed panel, which opened onto a vertical shaft of concreted walls. Though it was on the 2nd floor (room 202 - avoid it) it might as well have been in the basement, even in the middle of the afternoon it was as dark as night in there. It was also tiny, with just enough room to get round the bed. We walked straight in and out again, and were moved onto the seventh floor and an altogether nicer room: with a window, natural light and good views over the city. Plus around twice the floorspace. Outrageous that the hotel could try to pass these two rooms off as being of comparable value. One is well worth staying in, the other I wouldn't spend a moment in there even if you paid me.
