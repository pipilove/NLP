Perfect stay in Barcelona

My husband and I just returned from this hotel this week, stayed June 2nd, 3rd and 4th. The hotel exceeded our expectations. We loved the decor and the welcoming staff as we checked in. We stayed in a superior room and I would recommend that , the other rooms we peeked in seemed a little small. Our room also faced La Rambla, with absolutely no worries of hearing the street noise at night. We absolutely loved the upstairs outdoor pool and bar on the top floor of the hotel, great for relaxing and having a glass of wine to watch the sunset. We did this as soon as we checked in! This is a romantic setting, that I will never forget. Our plug did not work either in our bathroom, not sure what the deal is with that, but I just used another plug, hopefully they are working on that. We loved the hotel all around. Swanky, but in our opinion comfortable - not pretentious at all. I would recommend, you will not be disappointed. My husband and I travel a lot for work and throughout Europe, so we have a very good idea of what works and if we ever went back to Barcelona, this is where we would stay. Other tips.. Restaurants ... Taller de Tapas, EXCELLENT for Tapas. Also, PLA.... great small romantic place for dinner. Great food too... Both are in the Barrio Gottic. walking distance to both.
