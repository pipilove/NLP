Toilet flushing in the bed

We had booked a room here for 3 nights, we only stayed 1 night, we couldn't have stayed one second more, even though it was prepaid and no money back!The construction of the rooms are such that the toilet with a glass door with a big modern hole in it, flushes exactly beside the bed which is situated less than app 40 cm from the mentioned glass door.The room had a tacky decor and had morning sun which heated the room totally even though we had the blinds down etc etc - a horrible experience.However, we were so lucky to get a room at another small hotel in Berlin, which opened just 6 weeks ago, this hotel had a so called open bathroom BUT with a seperate toilet with a door you could close, and we managed to save the holiday ;)
