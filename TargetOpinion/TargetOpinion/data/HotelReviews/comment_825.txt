Dishonest Housekeeping Staff

While the hotel was okay with big rooms, the housekeeping staff was dishonest. First. The day we checked out, I accidentally left a magazine in my room , when I came back for it that same day, my magazine was gone. According to the receptionist, the housekeeping had not reported that any items were left in the room. I am certain that my magazine was left in my room which leads me to the conclusion that it was taken by someone from the hotel. While it may be just a magazine, the fact that it was taken reflects badly on the character of the staff. Second. We borrowed a CD from the reception and left it in our room. When we came back in the evening, it was gone. We do not understand why the staff took it away from the room without telling us. Worse, the hotel was going to charge us for the CD if we hadn't told them that someone had taken it from the room without our knowledge.I would not recommend this hotel on the basis of the above incidents. Moreover, this hotel is not really centrally located.
