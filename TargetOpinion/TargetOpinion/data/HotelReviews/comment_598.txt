Overbooking notice 1 day before arrival

Ok so I never actually stayed at the hotel, but if this is how their service operates then they deserve the 1 star rating - as does Opodo who I booked through.Booked the hotel for two nights over a month and half a go - money taken, and all booked up according to Opodo.18 hours before depature and Opodo call to say the Hotel is overbooked and that they can't get us a room, and the Hotel is offering hotels of much less quality to stay in instead.Awful.
