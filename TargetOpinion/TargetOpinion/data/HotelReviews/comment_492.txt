Excellent value and quality

We stayed here for 3 nights 26th - 29th Jan and were very pleasantly surprised at the great quality of everything in this hotel. Everything is spotless and well maintained and the staff are very helpful.The thing that shocked us most was how reasonable the prices were for this standard of hotel. Dublin and the Costas in Spain could learn a thing or two about ripping people off. The room service menu and minibar charges are excellent. 3 euro for a beer/vodka and 8 euro for a deluxe burger with all the trimmings delivered to your room! I call that value! The room was very stylish and a good size with a very comfortable bed! Hi Fi and large screen TV, bathrobes and slippers all very nice quality. Great bathroom with twin sinks and a speaker from whichever device you have on in the bedroom. All in all the nicest hotel I have stayed in and at æ‹¢65 BB a steal. As Arnie says I`ll be back!
