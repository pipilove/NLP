Great location, nice friendly staff

We tried for the Packing Package when we booked online but it was not being offered. When we called the hotel directly and mentioned we had stayed there before they were very nice and gave us the package. They also try very hard to give you a quiet room if you request it. It's an older hotel and the rooms are clean and average size for the Union Square neighborhood. If you like being in the heart of it, the location is great and in a very safe area. The staff is friendly. The parking is either valet (an additional cost) or park yourself at a garage around the corner. We chose the park yourself and the advantage of retrieving your car quickly is a plus in our book. There are times in the past at other hotels that we have waited up to an half hour for our car. We would definitely stay there again.
