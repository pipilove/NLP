5 mins from central station, â‚¬7.50 taxi fare from station, 5 mins from dam square, ticks all the right boxes, i would have qualms about stopping here again the next time i'm in amsterdam, the hotel was run by friendly staff and the rooms where cleaned daily, rooms where reasonably priced and comfortable, if your considering stopping then you have no worries that you will be dissapointed.
