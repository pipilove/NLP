Worst hotel experience ever

I was staying here on a business trip and booked it based on the website photos, which all show lovely renovated rooms. When I checked in I was given probably the one of the worst rooms in the hotel. A single bedded room in the un renovated part of the hotel. The bed was sagging in the middle and my bed cover had a cigarette burn. I could not change the rooms and was told I could not cancel them either. I eventually ...after lots of discussions.....got moved to the renovated part of the hotel but on a smoking floor so had to keep the window open to eliminate the smell and it was cold outside! Also the restaraunt is dark and dingy and the breakfast cost a whopping 22 euros each. The head waiter scolded one of the waitresses in full view of the customers. The staff on reception were not helpful and did not seem to realise the customer came first. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone
