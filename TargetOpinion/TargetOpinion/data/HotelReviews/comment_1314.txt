Nice, but not a wow

This is the second time I have stayed at the Omni, both on business. The Omni is a nice 4 star hotel. The rooms and bathrooms are of average size, but quite adequate. The furnishings are in good condition except for the carpet which is very tired and in need of replacing. The worn state of the carpet really detracts from the rest of the room. The internet connection, although it uses a wire, was fast and reliable ($10/day). The staff was very friendly and helpful. For example, they set up transportation for me on multiple days without a hitch. The hotel food is only average in quality, but very expensive. The hotel is located not far from anything, but not close to anything either; a geographical compromise. I timed the walk to Union Square at 15 minutes via Montgomery, hang a right at Post (note this way is flat, no hills). San Francisco hotels are very expensive for what you get. The Omni is better than both nearby Hyatts. I would stay there again, but will likely try another hotel on my next visit.
