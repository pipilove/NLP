A good hotel located at the centre of the action

The 1898 is a good, modern, efficient hotel located at the top of La Rambla.It seems to have been recently refurbished, and to a high standard. The rooms are dark wood in decor and have an excellent lighting and air-con system.The spa downstairs is adequate. The pool is small but comfortable, ditto the gym.One let-down is the bar area, which is long and narrow and a bit soulless, but as you've got literally hundreds of fantastic bars on your doorstep in Barca it's not a problem.Even though it's located in the heart of La Rambla, the interior rooms are extremely quiet, so sleeping is not a problem. I took my 75-year old mum to the hotel and she slept no problem at all.
