very nice hotel - the location is not too nice, but the hotel is easily accessible between two metro stations.

Rooms do not have their own air conditioning; temperature is adjusted by receptionist so it was too hot for us at night. Also, cleaning lady has a very strange way of checking if guests have left the room - she just enters the room without knocking, a bit surprizing. + the overall experience was v. good - the building is newly renovated, rooms are clean and nicely furnished. Bed sheets and towel are fresh and new. Good value for money.
