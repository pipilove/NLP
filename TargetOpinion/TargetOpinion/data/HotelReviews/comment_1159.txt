Awesome Visit!

What a wonderful boutique Paris find! Hotel is in a great location, near the Tour Eiffel, and Dome Church, close to Metro, and within walking distance of Arc de Triumph and more! Arnaud was very helpful, and gave us great recommendations on restaurants in the area. If you are looking for a personal, quaint, friendly, clean, quiet, restful haven from the hustle and bustle of Paris, Hotel de Londres Eiffel is for you. We were recommended this hotel by a friend who has stayed there twice, and we were very happy. Remember, you are not in the states, rooms are small, but very clean, and private bathrooms with elevator. We will definately go back and stay! Thank you Arnaud for making our trip easy and a welcome sanctuary after a busy day sightseeing! We loved every minute.Julienne - Orange County, CA, USA
