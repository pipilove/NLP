It's the little extras that make them stand out!

I have stayed in cheaper or similar priced hotels which to all appearances compared with The Hotel Fita. However it's the little extras that they offer that makes them stand out.The staff were polite, friendly and helpful. We arrived two hours before normal check in but the staff priortised the preperartion of our room and had it ready for us within the time it took us to pop out and get some breakfast.They made us feel welcome bringing us a drink and some nuts to nibble on when we checked in.The hotel offers free phone calls which saved us paying outrageous hotel call charges or the grind of finding a phone to call home and check on our son , (I hadn't realised how much easier this made life!)The breakfasts were really good, plenty of choice with eggs and bacon, croissants cooked meats etc.They are happy to do your laundry free of charge and when we checked out we were given some home made jam a fridge magnet of the hotel and some sweets in a little gift pack. I was really taken with the place and will definately go back and also recommend it to friends.
