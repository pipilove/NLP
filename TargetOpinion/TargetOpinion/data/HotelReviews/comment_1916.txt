Just horrendous - do not stay here

My family and I normally stay in upscale hotels when we travel, but we have pretty reasonable expectations. In other words, one wrong thing here and there will not bother us. That being said, this is THE worst hotel I have ever stayed at ...by far! I don't even know where to begin...employees were extremely rude and disrespectful during our check-in. We had arranged for early check-in over the phone, yet they claimed no such arrangement was made and refused to give us a room. We had a really tired little one with us, which made all this even worse. Anyhow,a few points, to keep it brief:* hotel is pretty run down: public restrooms were missing locks, doors were scraped, soap dispensers broken; rooms are small and completely outdated, air quality not very good* staff is non-responsive and you have to ask multiple times for whatever you need* hotel food is HORRENDOUS. we are by notmeans picky eater but i can honestly say that i have never ever had food this bad...anywhere. i think i would rather walk into KFC and have one of their chicken meals than eat at 4Season's Kable again...and I am a vegiterian! You truly know the food is inedible when even steamed rice tastes bad.Anyhow, this is our first trip to Sydney so I don't know what other hotels in the city are like, but this one should not be given more than 1 star!
