Not bad but not great

On the whole, not a bad hotel but not one I would go out of my way to stay at again.Location good - but more Chinatown than Darling Harbour. Don't expect any great views.Hotel a bit dated in places. Corridors bleak, bathroom furnishings worn. Rooms basic with small soft beds. Noise from adjacent room doors slamming was a significant problem - why can't they fit something to reduce this source of noise.Monorail audible right up to top floor where I stayed but not a nuisance. Lifts slow and housekeepinmg have an annoying habit of ringing you at 11am if you haven't vacated your room to ask if you want it serviced (or effectively to wake you up). Another annoyance was the hotel internet access, for which you can buy a card for $5. This is supposed to give you 25 mins of access, but if you use the card more than once, it debits an access charge and rounds minutes to the nearest five. In other words you get very little for your money and there are far better value Internet cafes within easy walking distance.In contrast to an otherwise mediocre stay, the reception staff I dealt with couldn't have been more helpful and are to be commended for their professionalism.
