Will not stay there next time

I stayed at W Seattle Hotel for two days. Room was reserved by a company I was invited by to Seattle for consultation. I personally would have never reserved a room in a pretentiously trendy place like this. I arrived at the hotel around midnight and was confused to see a bunch of drunken naval officers and sailors at the bar, that is basically right in front of the main entrance and greets you when you come in. I thought I got the wrong address as to me it seemed to be a night club. The actual reception was way above on the second floor that you cannot see from the front entrance. I gave another round in my car around the building to confirm that it was the right address. Only after I spoke to a parking valet, I realized that I got to the right place. Which brings me to parking. If you arrive by your own car be prepared to pay $30/day for parking, as there is no place to park your car.Everything was overpriced. No soda machine was on my floor. I was hungry and had a candy bar, a 12 oz can of cola and a small 12 oz bottle of water from a mini bar- that run me up to $14. When I asked for itemized bill for mini bar charges - I was given simple but firm No answer. So if you intend to use mini bar keep a tally, otherwise you might get charged for God knows what.The whole atmosphere of the hotel is that of a vampire castle. Everything is kept dark and dim with only mystery blue lamps to light up the way.The room itself was neither comfortable nor particularly clean. Bed smelled funny. Total price for a corner room with a view of an adjacent building's wall - $150 per day.So, decide for yourself. I am just giving the facts. As for me - I am staying Holyday Inn or Ramada next time.
