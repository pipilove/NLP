Great location!

I stayed at the Moore for 11 nights whilst on a conference in Seattle. It is in a great location - close to Pike Place Market and the major central tourist attractions are within easy reach.If you like luxury, you may be disappointed, but was lucky enough to get a room with a waterfront view and it was pleasantly furnished, clean and comfortable. Several of us stayed there and we were all happy with the value for money and service.
