Extremely Happy!!

My family and I stayed at the Andra in June. I can't tell you how helpful and courteous the staff was. We were greeted coming and going. They offered great suggestions on where to dine and how to get there. Each and everyone of them took time to give us directions on a map. The room was spotless and we loved the comfort of the bed. My husband usually can' t sleep in any bed but our own - he has back problems. He slept the whole night and woke up feeling great in the morning. The Andra puts the softest throw pillow on their beds. This is not a typical hotel, even the lighting is outside the box. I would love to have the nightlight in the bathroom in my home. We love the contemporary feel of this property. No white walls in this room. Warm colors. My children loved the televisionsets in the elevators and the ceiling lighting in the halls. I would recommend this property for any type of visitor and will definitely stay again if we go back to Seattle.
