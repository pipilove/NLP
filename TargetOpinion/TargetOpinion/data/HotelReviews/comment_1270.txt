very overrated

my wife and i stayed for five nights at the castle inn and found it very overrated in respect of the reviews it gets , it was reasonably clean and tidy ,but really just a room to sleep in,in a fairly good location,we paid the same amount in new york and got far better accomodation,we read all the reviews before we came and thought we were staying somewhere special ,we were wrong.
