I booked this hotel , direct, as part of a 3 night / 4day trip to Amsterdam.I was told about this by a good friend of mine.The hotel is just around the corner from Rembrant Square, and 200 mtrs from the no.4 tram stop.the outside of the hotel is nothing special, but when you climb the steps (only 4 or 5) and enter the lounge/reception area, you get a feeling of something special.The staff are friendly, professional and very helpful. one lady Nina, is a credit to the hotel !!!The 'Lounge' area is relaxed with comfy chairs and sofas, a fire in one corner, and NO Television !!!There is a bar that comes as complementary as part of your rate.The rooms are a decent size not massive, just right. We had the choice of a room with a canal view , which has a massive walk in shower, or a bigger room with a bath for 2 and a good size shower , but no view. we took the room with the bath and shower.All movies and in room drins are included.the bed was a good size king , and was really comfortable.We ordered breakfast in bed on the first morning , and it was delivered on time and hot !!!There is not many things wrong with this hotel, it does what it says, and with a certain style, that is not over the top.I could go on, but what i will say , is that we will be going back !!!
