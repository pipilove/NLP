Dream Located right in the centre of SF on Union Square within walking distance of Chinatown, top boutiques and restaurants. We were in the older tower (newer high rise behind it) and although the bedroom was spacious the bathroom was tiny and in need of refurbishment. The standard of cleaning left a lot to be desired and the main restaurant could not be booked at short notice for dinner because of the patronage of SF's rich and wealthy. However, one thing one won't do in SF is starve, as there are plenty of eateries close by. Hotel amenities included fitness and health spa plus business centre, however, other than the location there was really nothing to raise the hotel out of the average catagory.
