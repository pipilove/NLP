Great stay

This hotel is in a great location. We traveled in by public transport from Schonefield and it was really easy. The Ubhan is only minutes away and we used it a lot with our welcome card. This hotel is very clean and modern and has the best soundproofing windows i have ever came across, which is great considering the road outside is very busy.The breakfast is very good but expensive at 16euro so try to get the city break rate that includes the breakfast. Walking distance to the river and Berliner Dom and museum island. Overall a great stay
