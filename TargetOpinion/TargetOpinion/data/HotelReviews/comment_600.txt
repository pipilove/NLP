Looks nice but has a big problem

First impressions were great. Sexy cool lobby and understated but classy looks from the street. Up to the rooms with the cases and it still looked very nice and cool. However thats the first for two big problems. We had two massive cases with us and hand luggage, and the front desk was manned by two staff members and a porter. No other guests and no offer of any help with the bags. Amazing in a hotel of this class and price range. So being typically english we did it ourselves but not a good opening impression. By the way this was repeated on checkout. No help whatsoever and 4 members of the lobby team watched us struggle past to the taxi. The rooms are good. Well furnished with a super cool lighting system and very nice bathroom. However here comes big problem number 2. The rooms are REALLY noisy. You here everything from the corridor. Its like the door isnt even on. So if your looking for sleep or relaxation. Forget it. This is a party city and we were constantly woken throughout the entire night by drunken guests returning to their rooms. Not good enough for a Hotel charging these prices. You expect to sleep surely ?The rooftop terrace is fantastic ! Very trendy, cool and amazing views. The pool is very small though, but loads of places to sit / lie and catch the sun.So this is a Hotel for party people we think. Cool bar scene, and if your coming in late from clubs, you'll love it. However if your looking to relax and get a decent sleep, be careful as we didnt !
