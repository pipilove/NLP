Avoid it

We stayed at this hotel for one night. It was terrible, i never thought that 4star could provide such service.The room was too small and tiny, it was very very cold. Only one good thing that we didnt spend much time in the room.The room price was 70 euro per night, but when we were leaving they blocked at my credit card 200 euro plus that sum i payed cash. The staff was unfriendly, so we never come back to this hotel. I think its star rating must be as a 2* hotel
