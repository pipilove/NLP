We found the hotel to be very good overall. Staff friendly and attentive.Room was excellent overlooking the inner harbour and as we were on the 7th floor, we did not experience too much noise etc from the cruise ships and ferries. However a room overlooking the Trade Centre would probably have put a completely different slant on things.Breakfast was excellent with just about most things you could want and as it is buffet style, you simply have as much as you want from a very comprehensive choice.Other than breakfast we did not eat in the hotel, preferring to explore the city. The evening menu did not look particularly exciting in terms of choice but neither was it that expensive. Probably similar prices to many of the restaurants in the city.It is not too far a walk to Las Ramblas, the centre of much of the city's evening activity with the benefit of when you get back to the hotel, you are away from all the hustle, bustle and noise of the city.We would definitley stay there again.
