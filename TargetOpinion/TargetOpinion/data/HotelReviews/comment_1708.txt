overpriced, small, stuffy, noisy room

The very trendy decor, good restaurant and great location did not outweigh the negatives for this hotel. Three nights in our third floor room were claustrophobic. Too much furniture was stuffed in this small, dark room. We were tripping over our luggage. The air conditioning was noisy, but when we opened the window, we had to listen to some kind of generator from the building next door. At night, we had to choose betweeen hot and stuffy, or just noisy. The room was not worth the price paid, up to $239 per night for a King bed for two.
