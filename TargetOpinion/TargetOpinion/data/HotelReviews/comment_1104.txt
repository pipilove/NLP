Good location and decent room

We stayed at Hotel Langlois for 4 nights (18-22 Nov) and had room 62. The room was very clean and charming. Having said that we did experience not having enough hot water in the morning for showers and the room was not soundproof. We could hear all kinds of noises (i.e. elevator door opening/closing, footsteps in hallway, flushing of toilets, etc..) that prevented us from getting a good night sleep except on the last night when there were not alot of guests on the 6th floor.The receptionist recommeded a couple of great little restaurants in the area. Le Bistro Des Deux Theatres on 18 rue Blanche is an excellent restaurant that serves French food with a fixed menu of 32 Euro/person for a 3-course meal including coffee and a bottle of wine. Fuxi (sp?) is an Italian restaurant about 8-10 mins walk from the hotel and has very good Italian dishes. The price is very reasonable and the menu is la carte. We ordered off of the blackboard and was very pleased with our food.
