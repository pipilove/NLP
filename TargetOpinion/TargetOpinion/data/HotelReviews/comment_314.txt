Spend your hard earned money elsewhere

Spend your hard earned money elsewhere. I'm amazed that they continue to think Hotel Majectic is a 5* when they don't have a clue how to execute like one. Having us wait for our room for 1 1/2 hours way past the check-in time was not fair. After all, we paid their upscale rate and just want better treatment and service. 2 twin beds put side by side doesn't make it a king size bed and is most uncomfortable. Please refrain from using your renovation as an excuse for doing such a lousy job and consider lowering your rating for what it's worth, 2* maybe 3 and nothing more.
