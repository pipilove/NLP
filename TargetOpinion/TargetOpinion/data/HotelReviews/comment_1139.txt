Highly recommend - Friendly

We had three rooms and they were spotlessly clean and confortable. The staff was very friendly and Julie the Proprietor was so wonderful to us (3 women). Location is great, close to metro, also street market on Rue Mouffetard. Great air conditioning! We stayed 5 nights then went to the south of France and came back to the hotel for one night before leaving for the States. Can't wait to come back with my husband!
