Paying for Location

I stopped over at the Chancellor hotel for 5 days in November with my boyfriend and overall sadly we were left disappointed by our stay.My main criticism of this hotel relates to the poor quality of the rooms. The decor and standard of my room (and others that I saw when the maid was in!) were shabby and in need of repair, rather than charming or full of character. I may sound it, but am definitely not an overly fussy guest (!) having generally enjoyed my stays at different types of small/large/cheap/expensive hotels and accommodation, all over the world.Reading some of the other reviews, to ensure that you enjoy your stay, I recommend emailing Wes the General Manager beforehand so that he will juggle things in your favour.If you are not overly concerned by the standard of the rooms and location is everything to you, then this hotel is definitely for you. I think this hotel relies too heavily on its location in San Fran (and friendly lady selling refreshments in the lobby!) and should really consider investing in a significant makeover to the benefit of all its guests..
