Worst Hotel Ever!!!

We stayed at the Warwick for a night in October. Our original room reeked of smoke and so we were downgraded (they said that at the front desk) to the 6th floor. Our room was small and poorly furnished and stocked (no microwave, fridge etc.). They charged us more than the quoted price, but the confirmation email I received only contained the confirmation #, not the price, so we have been fighting this for 7 days now. To top it all off, we were charged for 2 nights! $487.51 total--it is not worth the money at ALL. We've been calling the hotel nightly and every employee we speak to is unable to fix the problem; we've been getting passed from manager to manager and department to department and we have to repeat our story and prove ourselves over and over again, despite being promised that it will be fixed immediately--I promise. This is, by far, the worst customer service experiences we've EVER had.
