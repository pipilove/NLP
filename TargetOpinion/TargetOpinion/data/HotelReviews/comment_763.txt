Lovely Hotel

 Visited this hotel for 3 days at new year and had a great time. Booked the hotel on Opodo for æ‹¢200 and the room was amazing. On 2 floors, 2 bathrooms and loads of space.The attractions are all close to the hotel and the new year party at the brandenberg gate was brilliant.Would definately stay here again without a doubt.
