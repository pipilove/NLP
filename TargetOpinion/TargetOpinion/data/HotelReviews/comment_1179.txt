overpriced, undercleaned

aesthetically the hotel is ok and it is in quite a pleasant part of Paris but it was grubby - from the first impression, a dirty lilac doormat - with a not clean whiff in the lobby and also quite noisy with guests knocking on the wrong (my) door through the night and brazen about the disturbance. The bedding and curtains were clean but the bathroom less so. Furnishings like the door displayed the organic trace of previous occupants. The lavatory had not been properly cleaned for some considerable time and the tiles by the shower were grubby, with engrained mould in the grouting. The tiles on the walls were also not clean.Happily, opposite the hotel is a supermarket which sells bleach and other cleaning materials. The bathroom was not quite as daunting or whiffy after a bottle of bleach down the loo...Some hotels supply slippers and in others one leaves slippers that have become dirty. This definitely fell into the latter category: I simply do not understand the rave reviews others have given and did not feel able to risk the breakfast.I also do not agree that the staff were good.
