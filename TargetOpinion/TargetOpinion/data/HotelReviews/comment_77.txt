So-so

This hotel is located directly on Dam Square, in the historic center of Amsterdam. Incidentally, it is also on the edge of the red light district. The rooms are spacious but dated and in need of renovation (especially the bathrooms). The common areas could be updated as well. We ended up moving after two nights.
