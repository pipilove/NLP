Avoidable but for the location

To start with the good things...in fact perhaps the only good thing....the location of this hotel is really nice! On the Union Square right near the Macy's and otehr shops etc.!Regarding the other stuff.. the hotel is really run down, the rooms and lobby badly need a renivation...the staff a lot of training!Go there if you must only for the location but for all else look elsewhere!
