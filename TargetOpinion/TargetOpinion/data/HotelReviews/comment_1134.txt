Great Hotel but California Grill is a joke !

We have just returned from a magical stay at the Marriott Village Ile de France which was excellent. On our last evening we booked a table at the California Grill / Disneyland Hotel for our 8th weddding anniversary. The place has an upscale interior decoration with exception of the circular soulless salon , down the left, from the open kitchens. We ordered twice the 49 euro menu which was of very poor quality. My prime rib was the worst I have ever eaten, hard like a rock. The Béarnaise sauce was served in a mignature glass and quite disgusting. My wife went for the Sea Bream with black Thai rice, completely dry and tasteless. When she asked for a portion of pommes purée it was not available. Our 4 year old son wanted some mayonnaise for his carbonised burger. This was also not available.The hectic , over- nervous waiter in our section forgot all our drink orders, brought us the wrong desserts and was above all unfriendly to somewhat rude. The girl clearing the tables next to us put all her fingers in the glasses to take them to the bar,... what a service. On several occasions you could also hear the chef scream like mad when kitchen doors opened. It added to the general atmosphere in the place. Please, people at Disney, hire someone to get this restaurant sorted !
