Pleasant 3-star hotel on the left bank

I just got back yesterday. Stayed at the Agora St. Germain for 5 nights. It was a very nice little hotel and I would recommend it to those on a budget. I paid 112 Euros for my single room. My single room was very small but manageable. Desk, chair, bedside table, mini bar, good lighting (often lacking in Paris hotels), comfortable single bed, two pillows, adequate closet space. Room was well cleaned every day. Bed very comfortable. Room was on an air well so very quiet at night. Staff was friendly and spoke pretty good English.The bathroom was very nice in marble and modern appliances. But it had that situation often found in Paris - no shower curtain. Nice thick towels.Had breakfast the first two mornings. It cost 10 Euros, which was a lot for what they offered: baguettes, croissants, butter, jam, juice, so - so coffee, packaged cheese and canned fruit cocktail. If you go out the front door of the hotel, turn right and go to the corner, there is a small cafe where you can get a terrific coffee au lait and a nice croissant for 3.80 Euros. And the lady who runs the place is extremely pleasant. She will also do eggs if you wish. The location of the hotel is great as other reviewers have pointed out.
