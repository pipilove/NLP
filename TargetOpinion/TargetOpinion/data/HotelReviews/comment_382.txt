To be right in the heart of the action, you couldn't find a better bet. It was so easy to get anywhere- the tourist busses are close by, amazing (but touristy) restaurants, great shopping.HOWEVER...this is a noisy, bustling hotel. Do not stay in an interior courtyard room on a weekend- as all the windows face each other, and you can hear people partying (or whatever) until 3 or 4 in the morning. Also, the beds are like rocks (as most European hotels are) so be prepared to see your chiropractor!
