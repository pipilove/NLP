Model, modern hotel

Our Andra Suite was large, bright, and attractively furnished. Art deco with modern touches. We saw one room with a large flat screen TV on the wall.And the bed was very comfortable. The only negative about the room was that the closet could have been larger.The hotel is well-located -- only a few blocks from Pike Place Market, Nordstrom's, and Macy's.The hotel would have been more convenient if it had a news stand/gift shop, but there were plenty of stores nearby. There didn't seem to be a concierge, which didn't matter to us but might to some guests.We would definitely stay there again.
