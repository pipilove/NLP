no color, no taste

If you're in Berlin for business, then it's OK I guess. Very asseptic hotel with so-called modern rooms, not very much to my taste. Felt as if I were staying in a big factory... In the room, you have two side openings for the shower and the WC with NO DOORS !! If you share the room, make sure you know the person well. And this was a superior room. The smell from the WC and the shower was not welcome. The furnishing was very poor and tasteless. The breakfast was OK, with lots of choice, but too crowded. The hotel is in a very good location, close to the train station and other city attractions.
