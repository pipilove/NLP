Creepy Wow.

Where do I start? This is the creepiest place I've ever seen . If you like a giant red, plastic (?) check in area; a blown-up pic of a naked woman plastered on the wall upon arrival; dark, narrow, creepy hallways with an eye chart plastered at the end (what the hell was that all about?); a Campbell Soup-sized elevator with no access to stairs (they're for emergencies); a micro-bathroom and condoms and a vibrator in the bureau drawer, then this might be the place for you! Creepy, freaky, cold, unwelcoming, scary and did I mention creepy? I canceled my second night and got the hell out of there. I don't even like Seattle now. Yuck.
