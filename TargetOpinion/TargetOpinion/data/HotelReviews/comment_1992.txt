Great Place to Stay!

I booked my stay here after reading the reviews on TripAdvisor and I am very happy that I did! The staff was friendly and helpful, rooms were nice and clean. I recommend getting a room vith a view of the Park. Also it was very convenient location right across the street from Hyde Park and St. James Station. It only took us 5-10 minutes max total to get to Circular Quay . Shopping Malls and Shopping Arcades were around the corner. Concierge is very helpful and friendly, not snobby like other hotels. I highly recommend trying their breakfast buffet atleast once, (it is pricy $40 per person, but a lot of variety and great fresh fruit)\If you don't have much luggage very easy to hop on the train to St. James station to get to the hotel, its faster than taking a cab. Cab to hotel is about $35-$40.
