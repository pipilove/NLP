Stay away during renos

We stayed here for 4 nights in early/mid February, after much research online and in travel books. I thought that I had found accommodation that was both within our budget and of high quality. Yes, there IS construction going on, and it started every morning at 9:00am for us; if you will be gone by this time, and away until after supper, then there shouldn't be a problem, provided you have a room facing the courtyard (away from the busy street in front). Issues we ran into:-Didn't have the room as requested in my reservation, so they had to put me in a queen bed on day 1, then move to a king days 2-4.-The first night, we also had to be moved at 2:00am because our ventilation started clicking non-stop--repair person came, suggested we just move rooms. Would have been ok, if not for:-Construction at 9:00am each morning. Heard it loud and clear on floors 2 and 4.-Also, placed us in a king suite that was joined with another room via a private doorway; the noise from the other family with kids was evident as of 7am as well. But, we couldn't move again because there were no other rooms available with king.-Showed up for breakfast in their restaurant at 10:31am--I'm not exaggerating--would not serve us, since they said they stop taking orders at 10:30am--the place had one other couple in it--could they afford to lose business over one minute? I guess so.Perhaps I had higher expectations, or perhaps not...Staff at front desk was fine, obviously the restaurant could use some work...Rooms were clean, always done promptly. Location was nice for getting all around the city; we mostly walked from place to place, even to and from downtown along the Embarcadero.The reno's look to be in full swing; I would doubt anything will be winding down in the near future; I'd certainly call their front desk and make sure that there are NO renovations being done prior to coming. Happy travelling!
