The hardest bed in my whole life

My husband and I spent a week in Paris on Jan. 2004 and we've booked this hotel because of several reasons: 1. The feedback was positive.2.The hotel looks very cozy in the photos.3. The location was very convenient.When we got to our room, it was quite small, with quite a few spots on the carpet, but the decoration of the room was welcoming and warm. When we went to bed, after five minutes my whole body started to ache because of the hard bed. It seemed that the floor would be softer. The bed also was shortso my husband's feet were hanging in the air. Well, I almost didn't sleep that night, nor the following two nights. On the third night, someone was smoking in the lobby and all the smoke got into our room and we had to sleep with an open window. This was the last drop and in the morning we mowed to Marriott that had a room twice as big and a huge comfortable bed. What a change! Although we missed the personality of the Relais Bosquet hotel.
