Modern German Chic, at a price

I stayed at this hotel for three nights, for a conference. On the day I arrived, Germany was playing in the finals of the Euro2008 football competition - so the streets were full of noisy fans. The hotel arranged for me to have an inside-facing room, to avoid the noise: full marks for customer service!The whole place is very stylish and efficient; clean and well-maintained. The reception staff were exceptionally helpful (in English or German!). As a business hotel, it would be hard to beat: the location is also great for West Berlin, and there's a U-bahn station right outside if you want to travel around the city. The bedrooms was well-appointed, and comfortable, with a fairly firm bed. The espresso coffee machine was a nice touch. The gym facilities are a little basic - some cardio machines, but almost nothing for resistance. The sauna, however, was very fine (do remember to take a euro coin for the locker).Breakfast was pretty good, with a wide variety including big jugs of freshly-squeezed juice. The conference meals were in private dining places in the hotel, and were also superb. All this comes at a price:the conference rate was EUR 150, including breakfast. Some people said you can get a better price than that on the web: even so, it's certainly not cheap! The only other downside was that, with all the conference delegates wanting to be fed half an hour before the conference started, there was sometimes a queue for breakfast. That smacks of bad planning.
