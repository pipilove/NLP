Good value short stay

Stayed here for two nights in January with our teenage children. I think they did a fantastic job considering Sydney and this hotel was packed with England cricket fans. Staff were friendly and helpful. The cheaper restaurant downstairs was great for children, if a little lively. The room was perfect for what we wanted; two queen beds and coffee-making area. It was clean, modern and in a great location. What more could you want?
