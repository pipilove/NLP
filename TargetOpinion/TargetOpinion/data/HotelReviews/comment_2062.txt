Hotel Altamont in Sydney Hotel Altamont, Darlinghurst Road, Sydney

We had a very bad experience with this hotel. Even if we booked and payd a lot of nights in this hotel the manager behaved with us very rude and illoyal. So he promised to put us on the waiting list for the 31th of December and 1st of January and if he gets a cancellation, we get this room for sure...He got a cancellation but he gave the room to the first two guys entering the hotel... By coincidence we were recognising it at this time but it was to late already.Even if the Hotel is not too bad, this illoyal, rude and stupid behavior to good-paying guests is not excusable and gives a very bad light on Sydneys Tourism Industry - so stay away from this Hotel - there are much better places anyway!
