pretty much ok.

We stayed for 4 nights in the Park Inn Berlin in January 2007. We've been to Berlin a couple of times before, so we already know a few hotels in the city. Our first choice (schoenhouse appartments) was already booked and since we booked the night before we went most places in the city were booked. This is how we ended up at the park inn. Now the hotel itself is located right on the Alexanderplatz and very near the TV Tower. It's not the most beautiful area of berlin, but you're close to all the public transport, close to Hakkischer Markt (nice area), well you're pretty central in berlin so that's very good!The hotel doesn't look very charming from the outside, but the rooms are pretty good, with (if you're lucky to get a room on a higher floor) great views of the city! The rooms aren't very spacious, but sufficient. I don't think we'll come back to this hotel, but all in all it isn't a bad choice.
