Somewhat Mixed Feelings

We just returned from a three night stay at the Hotel de Varenne. We stayed there based on reviews on Trip Advisor. We found the hotel to be nice for a three star hotel. The location is a bit off the beaten path, but we knew that from other reviewers. We found it odd that they allocated just one tiny box of tissues with four tissues inside, for two people for a three day stay???? Some of the staff were very nice, some icily helpful. The hotel was clean, but not spotless. There is no help with bags and the elevator is very tiny, which makes it difficult to transport your own luggage if you have more than a bag per person. We have stayed in many hotels in Paris and overall this is not a bad choice. We didn't leave the hotel with a great feeling, but we wouldn't tell other people not to stay there.
