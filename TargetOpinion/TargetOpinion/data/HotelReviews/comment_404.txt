Central and well looked after

We stayed in Barcelona for 3 nights in Hotel Royal. It is cituated in La Rambla which is the most touristy area of the city. Also close to the metro and buses and I would say an ideal location. We had a room on the fifth floor looking at the back. No view at all. Just facing a wall. Not nice but we had booked via Expedia.com and the price was on offer. The good thing was that it was quiet. Breakfast was not included in the price. The room was good and very clean. Good facilities and well looked after. The attidude of the staff was neutral. Not very friendly or helpful but not rude. Overall good experience and probably I would recommend it because of it's location.
