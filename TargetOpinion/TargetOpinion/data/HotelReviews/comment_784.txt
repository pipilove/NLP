A little out of the way

First off this is a no frills hotel with no frills staff. It may well be a designer hotel but when I read designer, I see minimalist which is what it is. The rooms are spartan and unexciting, and the breakfast is very much lite. The other real problem with this hotel is that it is right at the wrong end of the Ku'Damm and not really close to anything, even a subway stop.This is the kind of hotel that may appeal to people in their teens or early twenties, being as it is an expensive youth hostel. I would not recommend it to anyone looking for a romantic getaway, sightseeing or other holiday. See what rate you can get, and then take something for the same price in Mitte.
