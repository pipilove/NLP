HATED the Park Hotel

I booked this hotel as I was on a business trip.I had to stay there for 4 days. The first room I was given was appalling, crampt, dirty with holes in the curtains and bed sheets, NOISY and as already commented - I had to put a foot in the bath in order to use the toilet!!I can't believe that this hotel has been awarded 4 stars. There was so much noise on the first night, that I had to move at 1 am. The second room was just a bad. After complaining to the management I was given an upgrade to a 'club' room. The club room was ok and of 4 star standard.I would not recommend anyone to stay there, the only positive comment would be the location. I complained to Le Meridien about this hotel and was offered a free night's accommodation there if I used it within 6 months HA! NO CHANCE!
