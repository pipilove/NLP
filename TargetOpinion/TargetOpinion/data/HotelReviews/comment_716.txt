Smelly....

Stayed here for a weekend in Februaury. Fantastic location. Everything within a stones throw of the hotel. The only problem was the smell. Our carpet had been washed and was damp for the whole weekend and they wouldn't change our room for us. It smellt so bad we couldn't stay inside for long, just to sleep and i had to buy air freshener so that it would be bearable. The staff were unfriendly and not willing to help us. Berlin is a fantastic city and the people are so nice, it was a shame that the Park Inn didn't reflect this.
