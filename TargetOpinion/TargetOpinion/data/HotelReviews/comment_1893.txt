STENCH - otherwise ok...

I stayed here in March-08  paid $220 for a double room with a king bed. Good points: * Location (if you like Darling Harbour). * View over harbour is lovely if you are high up enough. * Has a safe. * Walkway over the roads so which is a lot better than walking under the road when alone * Comfy bedBad: * Location (I prefer &quot;The rocks&quot;) * The city view means you look straight into office buildings. * Weird aircon that didn't make any sense  I couldn't get it to do anything. * Hidden towels in the actual shower - spent ages looking for them. * The room was nothing special * The whole hotel stinks to high heaven of air-conditioner Other things I didn't like is that the restaurant is immediately inside the front door of the hotel. It didn't smell very nice either but then I didn't eat there. Very slow check in  totally lack of interest from reception.If I got a good deal I might have considered to stay there again but the stench of air-freshener gave me a pounding headache means I won't stay there again.
