don't stay there!

I encountered two big problems:a. more than one week has passed since check-out and 417 euros are still blocked on my card. The necessary payment has been made but this amount (which is more than what has already been charged) is still blocked. I called the hotel 5 times already, they say it will be solved, but nothing changes. They never say anywhere that some amount will be blocked on your card for weeks after the check-out.b. toilets are awful! they are transparent! if you are staying as a couple, you will have no privacy - you need to know that you will see each other in the toilet and while taking shower.
