Don't believe the hype

My wife and I were staying at another hotel while on business and decided to stay the weekend at the Chancellor (we booked it before we left). Unfortunately the hotel did not live up to the reviews. The room was small (not unexpected based upon other reviews), the room was very old and in need of a major renovation (a little surprising), the elevator was still broken (wow - I had assumed that would be fixed... how long do these things take to repair? and how many months ago was that first posting about the elevator being broken?). Staff - were marginal. They weren't so friendly / helpful but not bad either. Overall, the hotel didn't live up to the other reviews. Going back and looking at them now makes me think that they almost look too good to be true. The hotel is not a diamond in the rough, it is a budget hotel. Not terrible, but not good either.
