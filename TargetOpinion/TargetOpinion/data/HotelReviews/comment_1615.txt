good hotel

Stayed at this hotel for one night .Good Value, courteous staff. The morning newspaper was an added nice touch.Checkout at ipm was convenient. Loved the restaurant Lola certainly good food and good service inspite of being crowded. Perfect walking distance to the Sculpture Park where I spent most of the morning before my return flight home. Lots of small cafe's around.
