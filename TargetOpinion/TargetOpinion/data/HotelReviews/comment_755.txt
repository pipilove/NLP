very disappointed

Have just come back and was very disappointed. We got a room in the 1st floor and it was very noisy. The room was pretty small, very basic, the carpet was stained, the walls had many marks of what I guess are suitcases marks, and the shower floor had permanent dirt that didn't seem to come off. I would say that the only advantage of this hotel is it's central location. Would not suggest to stay there if you can afford some thing better! Looking back I would have preffered to pay more and get a better hotel.
