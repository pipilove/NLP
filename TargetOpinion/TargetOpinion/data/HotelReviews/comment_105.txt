In No Way a Four Star Hotel

This hotel is really not what it claims to be.It has ended up as part of Le Meridien as a result of their various mergers/demergers but it is in no way of international 4 or even 3 star standard.Reception were friendly and efficient but the decor is very dated and the rooms are horrible - small, tatty, very badly furnished. Even the bed would disgrace even a modest hotel.Le Meridien should either sell or sort out this hotel. At the moment it lets down their group.Location is good so if u get a VERY cheap rate u might risk it for leisure. But after a hard days work you will want somewhere better than this which is barely of tourist class.Must do better.
