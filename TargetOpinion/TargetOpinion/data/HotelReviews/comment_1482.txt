Nice rooms and public area, very poor service

This was my third time at the hotel. The first time I was put in the old building, and our room was terrible. The second time they comped my stay--had a great room overlooking Union Square in the new tower. This third time I booked 3 rooms. As an SPG gold member, I usually get upgrades. But the women who checked us in, would not even give us the king room we booked. My wife insisted on talking with the manager and we finally got our king room (but no upgrade). The room was in the old building, but it was recently renovated. The rooms was well furnished and appointed. But the service at the hotel is terrible. In addition to the check-in fiasco, we couldn't find a bellperson. They have one doorman for a 600+ room hotel. We ended up carrying our own luggage (including stroller) inside. Upon coming and going to the hotel, the doorman (even when he was not busy) never offered to help us lift our stroller over the steps of the hotel's front entrance. We asked the conceirge to recommend a good place for sushi. After a 5 minute wait, he came back with some places. We asked what he particuarly liked about them, and he said he just searched on Google for sushi. We ended up finding something ourselves since we know the area pretty well. So if you need a nice room in a good location, the St. Francis will fit the bill. But after staying in many SF hotels (we used to live in the city), we prefer the Omni, which has amazing service. Other good options are the Grand Hyatt and Marriott, both of which have better service than the St. Francis.
