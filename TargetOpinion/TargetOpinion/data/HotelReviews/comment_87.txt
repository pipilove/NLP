One NIght in Amsterdam

I have to say this was a great location for a quick trip through Amsterdam. We only had one night waiting on a flight to connect to the States. I called ahead to let them know we would be arriving early in the morning. The hotel did accomodate us, check in was quick and easy. The young men at the desk were very helpful. I did not see the perks that other five star hotels offer (ie. shuttle from airport), but it was comfortable and a great spot to tour from. We had a great trip. It was in walking distance to the Central train station, a lot of nice shops and resturants in walking distance. Our room overlooked an alley, so not a great view, but the room was comfortable. There was a lot of noise in the alley after midnight. I talked to the front desk about it in the morning, and they said I should have called them. Overall we had a nice stay. I would stay again, but not in an alley room.
