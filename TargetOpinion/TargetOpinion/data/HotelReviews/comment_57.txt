Wonderful Experience

We were traveling with a group of 5 couples and just completed a 14 day river cruise from Budapest to Amsterdam. Found the Estherea on the internet and it had received some nice reviews from fellow travelers. Price was right too. We were not disappointed. The rooms were spacious with a large bathroom. Our room was on the warm side but the hotel staff supplied us a fan which really helped. The lobby was had a wonderful decor and the staff was extreme helpful. Estherea is right on the Single canal and all the main attractions were within easy walking distance - Ann Frank House, Dam Square, Red Light District, Flower Market, etc. The hotel only serves breakfast which I thought was pricey. My wife ate there both mornings and said it was very good. There are a couple of pastry shops in the next block which were excellent. We highly recommend the Estherea.
