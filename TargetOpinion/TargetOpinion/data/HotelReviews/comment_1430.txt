Not Bad - Not Great

We stayed here in early August as a family of 4 w/ 15  12 year old kids on first trip to San Francisco. The hotel is a bit outdated; not rundown necessarily, just outdated. We had a gorgeous suite with wraparound views on one of the upper floors. The view was just stunning--we could see the Golden Gate Bridge out the bedroom window and the Coit Tower out the Living Room window. Service was fine; restaurant was ok. Nothing really outstanding; just average. This is probably a better business hotel than tourist place. But if you get a great rate or use points, it is just fine. The cable car was right there, there was lots of shopping. It was not the best part of town but convenient enough.
