more 3 star than 5 star

Living in Amsterdam I had always thought of the Krasnapolsky as a good 5 star hotel. But what a disappointment!!! We booked two rooms for party of four only to be put in separate buildings in complete opposite directions. When in the adjacent building you have to go through an alleyway so bring your coat even when going for beakfast. Although you could still freeze as you have to swipe your keycard about 10 times before it let's you in.When checking in, which took about 30 minutes, we were told there was no reservation, then they put our friends in a single room. This was supposed to be a royal executive room overlooking the Dam square. When rooms were eventually sorted out they had to change room again because of the foul state of the room. I have stayed in 5 star hotels all over the world and I have honestly never seen a 5 star hotel with DIY style bathrooms and laminate flooring. The hallways were smelly and messy looking. On top of that the roommaid kept asking when we were leaving as her her shift was nearly over ( this was at 10.45 a.m.) We had dinner in the Japenese restaurant as the main restaurant was closed for the holiday season. We made reservations for 9.15 but we should have made that earlier as they obviously wanted to close and fired our 5 course dinner at us in 30 minutes. This is good when eating a pizza. Finally it took us 45 minute to check out. Overall a crap stay and very disappointing. If you are looking for a real 5 star experience in Amsterdam stay in the Amstel hotel or the Grand. I rate the Krasnapolsky as a 3 star high street hotel. Good location is the only thing going for it.
