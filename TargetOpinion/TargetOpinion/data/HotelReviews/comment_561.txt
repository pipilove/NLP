NO SLEEP AT THE JAZZ WHAT A NOISE!....

Just returned after spending two nights from 21 to 23rd October 04 at the Jazz. After reading the great reviews for this hotel i was not dissappointed with the good standard of room etc, however, when we went to bed on our first night, WHAT A NOISE! . We first thought it was the sound of the lift going up and down. The noise seemed to be every 10 mins or so and vibrated the room. We changed rooms to the second floor, but the extreme noise continued. The next morning we spoke with the manager and discovered that the noise was from the MET UNDERGROUND TRAINS! . The manager did not offer any apology for our lack of sleep. We did move rooms again to the seventh floor, but every seven minutes the same noise shook the hotel. This needs to be mentioned to guests prior to booking this hotel. I would suggest that you take some ear plugs if you intend staying here!
