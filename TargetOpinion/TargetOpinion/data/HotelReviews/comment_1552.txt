Good value

We stayed here for 1 night in August and it was a good deal. We saved money staying in one of their shared bath suites. Convieniently, the room had its own sink. The room was clean but bare of any decoration. The shared bath was a little uncomfortable to use. You had to walk up a tiled step before getting into the tub and there were no bath matts. There was no space near the tub to hang a towel. We shut the window in the evening because of the noise from the street but when we turned on the fan it was even louder and I had to sleep with earplugs. This was actually not too big of a deal.The staff was very nice and helpful. They recommended a nearby grocery store for late night sweets.Being able to walk to Pike Place Market, which took about 5 minutes, helped us out because we had limited sightseeing time in Seattle.To sum it up, the room was uninspiring but for the location and price it was worth the 1 night stay.
