beautiful setting

stayed here for 2 nights in april. hotel was lovely. nice friendly front desk. stayed in room 12 over looking the pantheon. bathroom clean and spacious. sofa area in bedroom and bed large and comfortable. enough storage. down side was at night you could hear traffic noise over the cobbles outside and in the early morning you are woken by the sound of road sweepers!!! but this aside i would stay here again. beautiful decor. didn't have breakfast as we were out and about early. plenty of cafes, bars and restaurants nearby. we went to the moulin rouge which was a good experience, went down very well with my husband!!! book before you go. metro excellent way to travel as taxis can be slow and expensive. all in all lovely stay made more special by this lovely hotel.
