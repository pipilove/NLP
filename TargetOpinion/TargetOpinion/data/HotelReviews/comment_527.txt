Good Location, Great Service

We booked this hotel for a conference trip after reading reviews on TripAdvisor. The reviews were accurate - the hotel staff were the best I have encountered in a long time. They were helpful at all times, were able to recommend restaurants and bars to suit us and our plans, gave accurate directions, lent us an iron and ironing board, and kept the rooms and common areas very clean.The location of the hotel is excellent - it is a short walk to Las Ramblas and the Barri Gotic, a moderate walk to the shopping in L'Eixample, a department store/supermarket (El Corte Ingles) is within 3 minutes, and the metro line to the CCIB conference centre runs from Passeig de Gracia station, about 5 minutes walk away.As we were there on business, computer facilities were important. Wireless internet is free in this hotel. We were able to use the printers in the Hotel Regina next door.The room was long and narrow compared to other hotels, but there was enough space. The desk is only a fold down door on the cabinet in the room corner. There is a room safe. Many of the rooms open onto the atrium that stands above the lobby bar. This was noisy on the weekend night only, until about midnight. The front door of the room did not block out noise of the cleaning staff or neighbour's doors opening, but we have had similar (and worse) problems in other hotels in Barcelona.Breakfast cost 15 euros. I ate at one of many cheaper cafes nearby.
