Classy and comfortable hotel

Upon arrival at The Park Hotel, the staff could not have been more helpful, friendly and approachable. The hotel itself is in a prime location for the canals, museums, and some great bars and restaurants. The decor was fantastic, and our room was very well presented.Very clean, very modern and very comfortable...the bed was the most comfortable I've ever slept in!  We found that our basin did not have running water, and so contacted reception...the general manager came to deal with this problem within 5 minutes, it had simply been switched off from beneath the basin...a simple problem. Yet that evening we returned back to the room to find a letter of apology for the inconvenience....this was a very nice touch considering what little inconvenience it had actually been! I would highly recommend this hotel to anybody.My one gripe was that there was a slight sewage smell in our room, but we thought this was simply a smell in the air rather than a problem with the hotel.
