Excellent Hotel

Quiet situation in the Museum District, with easy access to public transport, Vondel Park, shopping area etc. with lots of very good restaurants, bars, brown cafes within a few minutes walk. Friendly staff, happy to give advice  information. Hans has a good sense of humour, in the Basil Fawlty style!  cooks a good breakfast. The hotel is spotlessly clean, rooms have everything you could want; there's free internet access, which is useful if you want info on local attractions, train times, etc  free 'phone calls - again useful to confirm local arrangements. Two middle-aged English couples would highly reommend this hotel.
