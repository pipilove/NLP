Awful! The hotel is supposed to be four star - not in my world it wasn't!

The staff were surly on the desk and the rooms were dismal. The bed had a plastic undersheet that russled every time you moved and made you feel like you were staying in a care home for the elderly.My room was too hot the air con wasn't switched on and on opening the window for air the room stank of frying bacon from the kitchen I suppose. I complained but was told there was absolutely nothing that could be done. I got no sleep as the next door room were obviously rekindling their love life and the sound proofing was non existent. I had the pleasure of visiting the hotel's restaurant - though restaurant is not what I'd call it. The staff were even more repugnant and the pizza I had was unbelievably bad. This whole experience cost 250 euros for two nights - my advice is don't ever ever ever stay at this hotel it was a revolting experience.
