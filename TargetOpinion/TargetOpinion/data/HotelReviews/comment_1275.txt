Do not Stay at this Hotel Its a Dump!

I would agree with previous contributions. This is hotel is not really a hotel but rather a run down MOTEL which you would expect to find in a very poor part of town.It is being dishonest to say it is a hotel. The room we were allocated was dingy, shabby and poorly decorated and depressing. I found the staff to be surly and unhelpful. The so called advertised breakfast is so poor as to be laughable. Nura-grain bars with a few pieces of fruit and yogurts.The pictures on the website are deceiving and deceitful do not reflect the true nature of this MOTEL. It is vastly overpriced for what it is in reality. If it was half the price it is now, it would still be overpriced.If you value your time in San Francisco, do yourself and your relatives a favour and find somewhere else.
