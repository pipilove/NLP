Great place to stay

Our first trip to San Francisco. The Castle Inn is in a great location to explore the city and great value for money. Very friendly and helpful reception on arrival and throughout our 3 night stay. Spacious room. Our 2 young children enjoyed riding the elevator! The free parking is great and no need to use the car at all while exploring the city. Recommended.
