This is not a contemporary or funky hotel, this is just a cheap dump. Don't be fooled by a meagre display of so called contemporary decorating.The building is very old with tiny tiny rooms and bathrooms. The rooms stunk of damp,mildew and really old wood. If there weren't new beds in the rooms, you'd think you were in the Bates Motel. The bathroom was decorated with a small bowl sink, but they left in the original tubs, yuk. All the fixtures are inexpensive, no art work, flat screen wasn't mounted to the wall, but the bedding was good. There is no where to open your luggage, you can barely walk around the bed. The elevator is a lift, fitting just 2-3 people, after long waits. The halls to the rooms are scarey, all dark and very narrow. There was not one impressive area in this whole hotel. Clearly this hotel has only had cheap cosmetic decoration to slip it into a 3 star categary, but it's still a dump.( putting Avedia products in the bathroom doesn't make up for the smell or the size) The decor and room size is comparable to a hostel, not a 3 star hotel. I strongly recommend paying a bit more and staying somewhere else, there are lots of other options around. A night or two at the Hotel Max could ruin your vacation.
