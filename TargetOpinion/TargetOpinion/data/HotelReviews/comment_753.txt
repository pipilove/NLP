Nice

 Staying one night in Berlin for attending a conference we - or rather my boss ;) - decided to go for the Art'otel. Fair price, nice stylish Andy Warhol Design elements, nice people working there and and a good night of sleeped located close to the Ku'damm. I surely will consider it as an alternative when returning to Berlin.
