what a dump

We stayed in this hotel i use the word hotel lightly .what a dump to arrive at midnight ,it was filthy ,but due to the late hour we stopped but never again would i stop at one of these places there ok if your a chav .dirty bed lined a truly awful room at the top ,no bar nothing we had to go out and find a shop to get somting to eat ,the bathroom was a disgrace .not to be recomended
