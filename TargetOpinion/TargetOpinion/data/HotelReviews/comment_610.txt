Disappointing.

This is an upscale business hotel, not a luxury hotel. The location is great, breakfast was excellent and the beds are fabulous but it lacks character and charm. There was no luggage rack although a call to housekeeping solved this problem. There was only 1 chair and the room was small. This was the last place we stayed after 2 weeks in Germany and it was disappointing to end our trip in a place that was so sterile and impersonal.
