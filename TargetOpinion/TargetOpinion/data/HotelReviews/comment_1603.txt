Pleased with the Sheraton

We stayed here for 2 nights after a cruise and were quite pleased. Got it via Hotwire for around $130/night (more like $155 including taxes) and subsequently read some reviews about construction noise so had some concerns. Not an issue. Our room was on the 25th floor and was quite nice. A typical conference hotel. Located in an area with lots of nice shops and restaurants, particularly in a shopping center only 1 block away. Also an easy walk to Pike Place market and the waterfront. The Greyline tour buses and airport shuttle have a desk in the lobby and it was convenient as we took a tour to Mount Ranier one day and also used the shuttle to get to the airport. The room was fairly spacious with a big window ledge you could set things on, a large table for a desk, two chairs and a table for a reading corner, 2 beds with comfortable bedding. Attractive decor. We checked out the pool and it was OK. Kind of small and very crowded with families both times we went. The whole pool is 4 feet deep -- no shallow or deep end. My only minor complaint was that it was difficult to access the free internet. They had one computer located at the check-in desk and I had to check 4 times before it was available.
