Charming boutique hotel on the south bank walking distance away from main tourist areas but far enough to feel homely. A number of local shops chemist, grocer etc cafes/restaurants on the doorstep including a cash till. Lovely hotel it is recently refurbished and fresh. I stayed in a standard room with shower - shower was great which is always a big relief in europe. Continental breakfast was included, its basic but generous and we love french breads. A la carte is also available and its well priced. The management and staff are friendly and their english is very good they made great recommendations for eating out and also booked taxis etc. This hotel will be our regular when visiting Paris.
