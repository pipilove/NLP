Worst hotel ever. Smells bad. A very bad hotel. To avoid.

First, the location. It's not that good for the center attractions and not well connected to public transports. Second, the staff. Very arrogant, not helpful at all.Finally the room. Kind of small, bad furnished and without any air-conditioning. I have stayed 7 nights and they just changed the sheets once and I think they never changed the towels.I have to refer to the most disgusting thing in this hotel. The bathroom have a open sewer of a kind, next to the bathtub that exhales the most noxious odor. And this was true in my bedroom and also in the other bedrooms of the hotel where fellow Portuguese travelers stayed.I most warn everybody to avoid this hotel.They haven't no English instructions for the phone, they don't have a proper luggage deposit, our luggage just stayed in the lobby and anyone can open it or take it. (We tried the last part and they didn't care)
