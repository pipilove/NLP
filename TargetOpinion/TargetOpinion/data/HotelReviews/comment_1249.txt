loved the chancellor

spent three wonderful nights [may 22,23,24]at the chancellor. there is no reason to look any further for a place to stay while exploring the city. the hotel is spotlessly maintained ,the staff was friendly,courteous,and helpful. location-location-location 1/2 block to union square, macy's 1 block, bart 3 blocks, powell street cable car out the front door[cable car passes available in the lobby]. we will not only recommend the chancellor, we will return. dave and sue moline,il
