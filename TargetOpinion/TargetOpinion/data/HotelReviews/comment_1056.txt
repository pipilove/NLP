Eh. So-so.

I'm sort of surprised at the rave reviews. While I don't have any major complaints about the St. Anne, I have to say I was far from impressed. True, the location is great -- right near Pyramides metro stop and within wakling distance to most stuff you want to see. And, heck, you walk a lot in Paris, so location is important.But it's very European. And, lets me honest, that's not always a fabulous thing, right? OK, so it had an attached bathroom. But no curtain and the shower head you had to hold over your head. Now I know why so many women don't shave. It's too freaking hard when you're balancing a shower head, razor and tiny soap. The rooms are very small, which is OK by me. But the AC was broken and we had to keep the windows open. Which would also be OK but it's a very loud street (even if it looks calm, the noise reverberates a lot. So we slept with earplugs in. And you think that you don't spend time in your hotel room -- after all, you're in Paris, right? But we walked proably 12-15 miles a day. (And we're big hikers in CA) and it's exhausting. And you're drinking wine, so you get tired and naps are nice in the late afternoon after most places are closed and you're waiting for dinnertime.And all that's fine. But if the main woman isn't at the front desk, forget about helpful dinner directions. And breakfast is OK, even though you have to walk by the maid's closet on the way to the basement where it's served. In the end, it was OK. I think you could probably find nicer places for the price if you really tried.
