Worst value in Amsterdam

This hotel was just a great disappointment.The first room we had had an average view on a small courtyard but it had two beds and we wanted a double bed so we asked to change. The second room had indeed a double bed, but it has a only a very small window facing a wall!Both rooms were small, dark, with average decoration and furniture.The decoration of the common areas does not match the standing of the hotel either, except for the bar and the restaurant, which are nice. However, they are on the other side of the buidings, and, in order to get there, you must take a long and gloomy corridor, with no decoration, which looks like you are in a basic motel.We used the room service for dinner the first night because we arrived late, and we also took breakfast in our room. The food was also very disappointing for an hotel which is supposed to be first class.
