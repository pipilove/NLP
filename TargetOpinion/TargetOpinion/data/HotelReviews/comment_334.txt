Tighter space than a ducks --- 5 star hotel i donéº“t think so....

Room was the size of a rabbit hutch and the service at check in was average for a travel lodge! The whole point of a five star hotel is to feal spoiled but all we felt was ripped off, a bit like all fur and no knickers!! Location is too far out compared with the Gothic quarter, the view from the roof top pool was great but unless your can swim in 2 inches of water dont expect to go too deep in the roof top pool
