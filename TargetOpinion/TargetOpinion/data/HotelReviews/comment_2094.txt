Average

I had a mixed experience at the Amora recently. They wouldn't check me in, even though I was only 15 minutes early. My room was nicely decorated but the blinds had holes and frayed edges and the tv was very old and stashed in a cupboard.. Good selection of free channels though. Bathrooms were very nice too. Lift lobbies throughout the building were very nice, although the ground floor lobby and bar on the mezzanine were very dated. Service was slow, and often disinterested. All of this would have been fine but it was quite expensive, and I have had much better experiences elsewhere for less. It was ok, but I would definitely look elsewhere if I went back to Sydney.
