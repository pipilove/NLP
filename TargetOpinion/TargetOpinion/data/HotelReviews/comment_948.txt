Not on the 6th floor

My wife and I stayed for 5 nights at this centrally located hotel in St-Germain des Pr√©s late Novembre 2006.The location is just fantastic, being close to all major attractions and nightlife.The staff were extremelly helpful and the rooms were very clean.The only negative aspect were the size of the rooms and bathrooms.This hotel has 6 floors and all rooms are mid-size except those on the top floor which are extremelly small.......I mean really small, and the bathroom....................incredibly small.I talked to manager and she told me that all rooms had descent size, except those on the 6th floor.So, if you go, don't book any rooms on the 6th floor.I would certainly stay there again but wouldn't stay on the 6th floor again even if it was free.I also booked my room months in advance and was sincerely hoping to get a much better room.Aside from that, I highly recommand this hotel.BTW, don't bother paying 25 euro for brakefast, as you can get plenty of great brakefast for a fraction of the price just around the corner.Cheers and Bon Voyage.PatP/S: I must also mention that I was extremelly surprised to see how clean the city was and how friendly the French were.I don't know where all the bad reviews comes from about the French but to us, they were just real nice.
