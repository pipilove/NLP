Truely a home away from home

My husband and I chose this hotel 11/06 for a pre-cruise accomodation since it is only 25 min from the SF airport and 10 min from the cruise port. We also had easy access to Fisherman's Wharf, 10 min from Chinatown and in the heart of downtown SF.Our visit proved to be quite memorable and the hotel exceeded our expectations. We chose to book again 2/07 with our very picky relatives. Initially, we were skeptical since the hotel was an older building, smaller rooms and not a big chain hotel, which they were use to.Again, the hotel met ALL expectations. My relatives commented: this hotel had character and charm, the room size was of little importance since it had the necessities of making it a comfortable stay, the staff was extremely helpful with booking our dinner reservations with a VIP card, booking our SF city tour at a reduced rate and being available when needed.If you want something different than the normal hotel chain room and service....this is the place to stay. YOU WILL FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE FOUND YOUR HOME AWAY FROM HOME....
