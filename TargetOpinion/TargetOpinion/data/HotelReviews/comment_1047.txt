Small and friendly

THis place is very well located to access the latin Quarter of Paris and is conveniently close for a short walk to Notre Dame and on to the Louvre and Toulieres Gardens. It is essentially a charming 6 storey town house with two rooms on each floor. I had a Superior room which was most satisfactory. Bedroom, lounge[ette], kitchenette and bathroom. Decor was pleasant and in good order., and not ,thankfully, matching pattern everywhere !The breakfast was adequate although I would suggest you bought your own croissant ,confiture ,coffee etc from one of the many food shops nearby and made your own in your kitchenette- the Salon for breakfast, although clean tidy and OK is in the basement and a bit ...lonely. The chap on the front desk was most helpful and courteous in his manner. One felt inclined to rebook here if wishing to be this side of the river.
