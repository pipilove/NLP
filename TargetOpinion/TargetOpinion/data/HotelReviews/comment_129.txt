Very poor response to a theft

Stayed at the hotel on a business trip. Was very pleased with the quality of the rooms - in the upgraded section. Stay was spoiled by the theft of my laptop. I stupidly left it behind when I checked out and went direct to a meeting. Three hours later I realised I had left it behind, phoned the hotel, fully expecting them to tell me they had it at reception. They handled the whole thing very badly. Didn't believe me when I said I had left it behind. Made a great show of bringing me back to the room to point out 'Look, no laptop'. Told me they'd take a step right back if I phoned the police. Subsequenly a senior manager phoned and apologised and explained that they can't outright accuse hotel staff..which I understand. But the whole experience was made so much worse by their initial handling of it. The impression given to me was almost like I was attempting some kind of scam. There's clearly a problem there. So I would never stay there again. The laptop was close to worthless, very old model, but I had years of personal stuff on it. I was foolish to leave it behind but I was extremely shocked that it wasn't handed into reception by one of the two staff who had been in my room after I checked out.
