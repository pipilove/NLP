Greedy at the expense of residents

Whilst the hotel is functional rather than luxurious they are willing to disregard the needs of normal residents to pander to the corporate function market. A conference at the hotel will mean that you are denied access to the main public areas such as the bar and will have your movement around the hotel restricted even if that does mean walking around the hotel in the rain.. it is clear that they value the corporate custom much more than that of individual travelers. Whilst it may be a business decision to do so the independent traveler should be aware of where they stand in the hotel's regard.
