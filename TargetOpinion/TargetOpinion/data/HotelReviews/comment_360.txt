Horrible horrible horrible service, great view, wouldn't send my worst enemy

Dirty, two sorts of staff, Mildly disinterested or downright offensive, for Euro 2000 a night we stupidly expected someone might carry our bags, the shower might work and there wouldn't be a pile of dirty dishes in the room - the apartment suites are very tired, quite grubby and deafeningly noisy. turn down service only works on the day you arrive, breakfast sucks, the doormen run away if you're lucky enough to make eye contact, and complaints are dismissed with fairly brutal accusations of lying. The Butler who greeted us on arrival,04/10, Peter, marvellous friendly helpful - though unable to lift bags - after that the unemployable took over - there are several much better places to stay in Barcelona, including the benches in the railway station.
