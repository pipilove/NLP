Good Location

We read mixed reviews of this hotel before we travelled .We arrived at 9.30 a.m and were given a welcome drink and a free breakfast and told rooms would be ready at 1.00 p.m.The room was small but very clean and the location was brilliant i do not understand people who complain about this hotel .GET A LIFE!!!!!!
