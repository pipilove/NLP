Enjoyed the Le Walt

brief report, but the hotel was very nice, up to date rooms on the typical smaller side. A smaller hotel with great service. Stayed on the 3rd floor I think and if you really worked at it you might hear the metro beneath. Several nice bistros in the area; very nice local market street in the area. Convenient to metro and the eiffelexcellent value for the money
