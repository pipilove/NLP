needs improvement

i have read all the great reviews in tripadvisor before booking this room but i felt it was quite a disappointmentthe hotel itself is just a 3 minute walk from the metro and the interiors of the rooms are fantastic. i like how the hotel was quite small and personal, there was free wifi and the receptionist was friendly.however theres lack of amenities and inadequate service.they dont have housekeeping so any problem you might encounter with your room (i had problems with the sink etc) had to wait until the next day. they never mentioned any tea/ coffee making facilities which is understandable but i wish that they would at least provide a spoon or fork in the room. they did not replinish toiletries too. i had to request it from them when i ran out on the fourth/fifth night..for other people who are light sleepers the rooms are not that sound proofed so you might hear bits of noise at night but it wasnt a problem for me.i understand that paris rooms are smaller than average so the room size was accepted as is. i did know how large the space would be before bookingthe biggest problem would be the service. we had a prebooked arrangement from hotel to the airport for free but the driver never showed up. apparently he did show up but the hotel reception told him that we had checked out THE DAY BEFORE. we waited for our ride without having any idea that he already left thanks to the misinformation.like i said the receptionist was friendly but have managed to make us spend an additional 52 euros on taxi due to carelessness.he didnt even offer to help us call a taxi when we said we needed to get a cab in order to make it to our flight. awkward moment of stares and what do you want me to do looks ensues.i would probably not stay in this hotel again. i do love the rooms but i dont want to get stressed during my next vacation.
