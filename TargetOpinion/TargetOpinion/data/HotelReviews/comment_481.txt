Wonderful Hotel with great service

I cannot believe the bad reviews given to this hotel by some reviewers. We stayed Sept 21-23, 2004 and had absolutely excellent service. We were greeted with complimentary Cava and chocolates for our anniversary. The rooms were huge and comfortable, with many amenities. We had turn-down service both nights we were there, and the breakfast buffet was excellent, even though we arrived at the end of the scheduled time.I suggest you try this place for yourself, and I believe you will be more than satisfied. It is right on the bus route, or 1 and 1/2 blocks away from the bottom of Las Ramblas--a pleasant distance to be sure. We would definately stay here again!
