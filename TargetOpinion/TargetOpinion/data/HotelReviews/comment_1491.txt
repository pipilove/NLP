not a good hotel....

I spent Tuesday night this week in the Westin St. Francis and it was absolutely the worst hotel stay I have had in years. Checking in was fine but they had no 'standard rooms' available so I was asked if I would upgrade and stay in a union square view room that had a murphy bed. I specifically asked when checking in if the murphy bed was of the same quality as the heavenly beds. I was assured it was.The room was ok (nice flat screen TV), but I had asked them to turn down the bed (ie: flip it down from the wall) while i was out at dinner. Arriving back later I ended up in a bed with a 10 cm thick mattress, springs that could be felt through the sheet and this WAS NOT a Heavenly Bed!!! It was absolutely brutal and just like a hide a bed on an old sofa bed. For 300 per night i was shocked.Then to top it all off the lady in the room next door started smoking at 5am, in a non smoking hotel. I eventually called at 645am and security came and stopped the nonsense. So with the bed being the most important thing i was looking for being completely disappointing, I would have checked out on that basis alone, the smoking was just too much. I will never stay in this hotel again and cannot believe just how bad it was. This hotel is OLD, needs a renovation desperately so wait until this hotel with a great location does that and then you can stay here.
