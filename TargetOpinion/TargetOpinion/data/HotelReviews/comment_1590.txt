Wonderful stay at the Sheraton

Stayed here for 2 nights. It was expensive (parking is $35/night) but it's only 5 blocks from Pike Place and roughly a 20 min walk to the Harbor Steps. You can catch the monorail a block from the hotel if you want to visit the Seattle Center. We stayed in the tower facing Union St which has been remodeled. We had a plasma in our king room and the furniture is contemporary. Really liked the room and had no problems with noise. If you don't mind spending a little, it's a great stay. Just make sure you stay in the remodeled section. And the concierge was extremely helpful. I believe the lobby has free wireless, but it may cost to connect in the room. The only reason I give a 4/5 stars is the ridiculous parking cost. I know it's a major city and it's downtown but I still think it's too high.
