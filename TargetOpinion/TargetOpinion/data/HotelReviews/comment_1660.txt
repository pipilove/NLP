Over rated .. not worth the $$$

First of all, I'm a Starwood Platinum Member and my family and I stayed for couple of nights here on the way to an Alaska cruise. I had reservation for two rooms using my Starwood points. Upon arrival around 1200pm, I was told that there was one of the rooms ready but the other was being cleaned. We decided to go around town and come back later.At 4pm we arrived back to the hotel and requested our other room, and we were told that was not ready because the guests requested a late checkout and they are cleaning the room. I did not believe that and contacted the Platinum Starwood Member assistance to complain and to check the possiblity to go to the Sheraton couple of blocks away. Once I explained the issue they inmediately contacted the hotel manager and the room, that was not ready 15 minutes ago,now is ready. Wow that was fast!!!!So five hours have gone by since we arrived and finally we have the rooms. The lobby was not that great. Music too loud that we could not hear each other talking. The rooms to fancy and lack of things that now, any other hotel has as a standard, such as microwave, coffee maker. I sent my son to get some ice. Yes, he found some on the 23 rd floor. one bottle of water was given to us as complementary due to the inconvinience for what happen during check in, the cost $8.00 each. and many more disappointments during the stay.If you want coffee in the morning, they tell you to go across the street to Starbucks. Can you believe it!!!! Any way it is cheeper and better.In summary, think twice if going there and staying here. It is not what is advirtised. And I agree with other people regarding hotel personnel. They only greet you upon arrival after that, you are one more guest/person at the hotel.
