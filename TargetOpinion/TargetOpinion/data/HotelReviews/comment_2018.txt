not returning

We stayed at the Travel Lodge for 4 days and really it was 4 days too long. We booked a double room with a queen bed and ended up with two single beds. The showers dribbled out water which was sort of warm but sought of cold as well and the staff were not friendly or helpful. We spent as little time as possible at the hotel. The rest of my family spend their 4 days at the Menzies Hotel, so we ended up spending a lot of time there and the change was unbelievable (for the same price). The staff were great, always helpful and cheerful, the rooms were so much nicer than the Travel Lodge and it just had a much nicer vibe going on. I will never stay at the drab and depressing Travel Lodge again
