A clean, reasonably priced hotel, not for the claustrophobic though

We stayed in the Hotel France Albion for 5 nights in a room-only basis, so I can't speak for the continental breakfast, but we found the hotel to be clean and the linen/towels/toiletries etc all to be perfectly acceptable, especially considering the price we paid for the rooms.They also provided us with a travel cot for our infant child, but with this in the room in conjunction with our suitcases, navigating the room became a bit of an obstacle course. The rooms are very small, I'm not sure if all Parisian hotels suffer from this due to the nature of the overpopulated city, but it was very cramped indeed.Despite this, we had a very pleasant stay, no real issues with noise or anything - although be aware that when exiting the hotel and turning left, when you pass the St-Georges metro stop you're more or less in red-light territory. We passed through it once or twice without any incident, so don't be worried, but just in case that would influence your decision at all.
