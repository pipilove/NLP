The Most Friendly Hotel in Paris

Booked 2 rooms via this hotels own website for a long weekend break, I had been to Paris twice before and had not been very pleased with the Hotels chosen, so this time I read a lot of reviews on Trip Advisor and selected Hotel Residence Foch because of its high rating. We were not dissapointed, in fact we were delighted with the very cheerfull and helpfull staff who made our stay a most enjoyable one. The facilities are great and the rooms although quite small are very well furnished with very good quality linen, ironing board and iron, hairdryer, lcd tv, mini bar, room safe and tea/coffee making facilities. The Bathroom was large and bright well supplied with shampoo, soap etc and also lovely towels. Next time we will book the larger rooms which cost about an extra 20euros per night but after seeing them it would be well worth it. ( Room numbers ending in 20 are the larger ones). It is in a good location for the metro and also in a very quite district, so if you want a good nights sleep this would be a great choice.Thank you Trip Advisor and Hotel Residence Foch
