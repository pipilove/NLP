Not that good

I honestly cannot believe the high score at tripadvisor. I usually choose my hotels based on the ratings here at tripadvisor and have never been disappointed. However, Esthera did not live up to my expectations. The room (512) was tiny, with a tiny bathroom which actually has no space to put the towels (stored on a rack above the bathtub). If you want to take a shower you have to throw the towels onto the floor. The furniture had several cigarette holes, although it was supposed to be a non-smoking room. The rooms are noisy due to the lack of any sound insulation. Breakfast is an extra 16 EUR per person which I thought was included in the price, another bad surprise. Staff is not particularly friendly. Location is quite nice, which is the only positive thing about this hotel.
