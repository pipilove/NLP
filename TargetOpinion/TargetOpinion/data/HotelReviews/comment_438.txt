It was just okay

I too read the reviews but wasn't sure about the location. The Ramblas can be rather hectic. Since we had two stays in Barcelona, decided to stay at the Montecarlo on the way home.I was impressed with the desk clerk and the breakfast, but my room was very disappointing. The carpets were stained and the room lacked any ambience. It was not a luxury room, nor was this hotel cheap. The room looked like a motel room. Aside from the fresh orange juice, good coffee and internet access, I would not stay here again.
