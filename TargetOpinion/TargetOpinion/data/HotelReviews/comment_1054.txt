Good Value, Friendly Hotel

I go to Paris in November every year for Christmas shopping. We stayed in La Pera last year but the prices had almost doubled this year so I went in search of a different hotel for this years trip. I looked on Trip Advisor and found the Louvre St Anne and I booked a triple room at this hotel based on the reviews it had gotten from Tripadvisor guests, its location and price. Overall we were very happy with the hotel. Our room was clean and bright and the bathroom was a good size. We had a small balcony which was nice to sit out on to get some air. The reception was manned 24 hours a day and the receptionists were very friendly and helpful anytime we needed anything. The hotel is close to the Louvre, Opera and the big department stores and there is a metro stop close by which makes the entire city accessible. There were some very nice restaurants in the neighbourhood - Willis Wine Bar and Liza's a Lebanese restaurant were two we ate at. There are also lots of Japanese restaurants along the surrounding streets but we didn't try any of these. Getting to the hotel was relatively straight forward. We got the Roissybus from CDG to Opera and I printed directions from Google Maps from the bus stop to the hotel which was about a 5 minute walk.A few slightly negative points I would make are that the lift is not big, the hallways are narrow and the reception area is small. Our room was also a little small for three people and the third bed was up on a ledge over the double bed. The hotel is however a three star hotel and so overall we felt the amount we had paid versus the other good points mentioned above made the hotel very good value in a city where many of the hotels are dingy and overpriced. Overall we were very happy with our stay and we plan to book this hotel again next year for our annual trip once the price remains reasonable.
