this is not the Ritz Carlton

It could have been so nice, Ritz Carlton standard in a European hotel. The Ritz-Carlton approach seems to be always a step ahead. But not here, this was just plain lazy, slow and bad service. I checked in with 2 friends staying with 3 in the room and although this was in the reservation and I was clearly showing up with total of 3 people, the receptionist gave me a room with one bed. When I called from the room, the same receptionist had the nerve to question my reservation and whether I was with 1 or 2 other people. Come on! Isn't that the Ritz Carlton approach to then just deal with the issue. Expecting a tip when the roomchange was eventually made was just an insult.The rooms are pretentious and boring.At 7pm I tried to order drinks at the pool but the bar was closed. The staff could not say another word than closed. Come on people?! Wake up! After I asked directly, the poolstaff would get someone from the bar, but this person never showed up. When I returned to the room in the middle of the night trying to fall asleep I noticed that the AC was not working. But at 4 am you dont ask for a roomchange. I discussed the matter at check out the next morning and just met stupid arrogance like the systems at this hotel are unbeatable. As compensation I was not charged for overnight parking, like that would make me feel better.I am avoiding all Ritz Carltons for the next century and suggest you stay away from this monstrosity in Barcelona. For half the money you'll enjoy the real barcelona experience.
