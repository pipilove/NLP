Not so Majestic

I stayed at the Majestic for 3 nights. The advantages were the location and the gorgeous Christmas decorations. But other than that, we did not enjoy this place too much. The room was the cheapest one, hence very small. Too small.Also it was so dimly lit that we had to ask for an additional lamp in order to read.Overall the room seemed to be rather worn out and old. They need a makeover sometime soon, at least by 5 star standards.The people at the front desk are not very friendly. They hardly smile.The worst thing about this hotel was that they mistakenly double billed me. They were not very apologetic about it either.I stayed at the Claris hotel as well, which is just one or two blocks away.If you are trying to decide between the Claris and the Majestic, I would definitely recommend the Claris.The rooms at the Claris are much more spacious, modern, stylish and clean.The staff are more casual than the Majestic and some people might not appreciate that, but at least they smile more and are friendlier.If I had known better, I would have stayed at the Claris the whole time and not have bothered to stay at the Majestic at all.
