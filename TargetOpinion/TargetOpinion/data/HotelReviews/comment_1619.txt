A Fantastic Seattle Boutique Hotel

Experience @ A Great Rate Three cheers for the staff @ the Hotel Andra. At all points of contact I felt welcomed  assisted in a professional but warm manner. We were provided a complimentary upgrade on our room type (without our asking) when the front desk noted that they had room to do so. Room service was fantastic (gourmet larger than life BLT sandwiches and delicious kebabs  dips). Big comfy robes, cool ambiance, and a blissful sleep. The hotel is a bit older (like most in Seattle) but extremely clean and decor has been upgraded with a modern contemporary look/feel. I'm confident that we couldn't have found a better boutique hotel for a better price. A great experience - we will stay here again next time we travel down to Seattle for a getaway weekend!
