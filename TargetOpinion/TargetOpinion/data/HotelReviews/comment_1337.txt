Great start to our holiday

We had a great four night stay at the Argonaut. Our rooms were large, clean and well decorated/furnished. The location is very convenient. The free wine hour is also a bonus - but a little early at 5-6pm.We had booked our rooms through an independent travel agent, requesting two double beds in each room. When we arrived we were given rooms with one king-sized bed in each, but these were changed without any problem after our first night. The desk staff were helpful about this. All the staff were fine, the bell boys were particularly friendly.We didn't notice any noise, and we were lucky with the weather. I would certainly recommend this hotel.
