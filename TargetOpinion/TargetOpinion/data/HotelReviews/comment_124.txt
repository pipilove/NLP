Great Stay at the Park Hotel

My husband and I have just returned from a two night stay at this hotel. We had one of the new refurbished executive double rooms on the 5th floor. While I was a little disappointed with the size of the room (quite small) and the view was to the back, the room itself was extremely clean and contemporary with a very comfortable king size bed. The bathroom was gorgeous with a rain shower (brill). The location was also excellent just five minutes to the Liedlesplain and right beside VondelPark. We didn't eat at the hotel as it was quite expensive relative to what was closeby. The staff were very efficient and couldn't have done enough for us. I would definitely return to this hotel.
