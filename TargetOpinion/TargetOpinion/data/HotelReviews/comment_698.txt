An excellent 4 star property

My second stay at the Grosser Kurfçœ‰rst was as enjoyable as the first, a year ago. Excellent location - calm yet only a 10 minute walk from the Museeninsel, with the U-Bahn in front of the hotel. Friendly staff at reception, bar and breakfast. Nice lobby with bar. Clean, quiet and comfortable rooms. The building is clear and bright. I will most definitely return here.Try and find a web deal (I booked via Hotel[-]): during Summer rooms can be booked for as low as 59 euro (and that includes breakfast).
