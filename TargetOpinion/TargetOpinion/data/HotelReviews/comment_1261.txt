Great value for money

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. The reviews on this site are spot on and this motel offers great facilities, clean rooms and a great location in a nice neighbourhood. All the main tourist sites are 15 minutes walk away. We found a great Japanese restaurant called Wasabi and Ginger on Van Ness Avenue just 3 mins walk away - highly recommended. We will be back!
