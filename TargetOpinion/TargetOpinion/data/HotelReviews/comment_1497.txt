The St. Francis just doesn't care

We stayed for one night. The room was fine for the price (Hotwire $65). We had a small bottle of wine from the mini-bar for $18. It was not bad. When we checked out, I told the desk clerk about the wine and paid $18. When we got home, two $18 charges were on our credit card bill. I called the St. Francis on a Saturday to get their mistake corrected. The desk clerk said there was nothing he could do and said I would have to talk to accounting between 9-5 during the week. He didn't offer to take a message and somehow seemed to suggest that this whole thing was my fault. It's funny how the hotel is able to charge your card 24-7, but when they take your money without cause, suddenly it's very difficult for them to give it back. Very poor attitude and service.
