SUPERB Hotel

I stayed in this hotel in January, there were 7 of us on the trip. The location was super and so was the hotel, I had a room overlooking the canal which was good, one had a room with windows very high so no view BUT they had a sauna in their bathroom,. The reception staff were very helpful to us and the FREE snacks and drinks were great, especially when you had been out walking all day. The rooms are small, the beds are comfy and the bathrooms great, The choice of pillows was great as I have a bad back and need good support. The only downside was the air con, a bit noisy, but switch it off and open a window instead. We ALL had a great time and the Hotel was GREAT. Would DEFINITELY stay THERE AGAIN
