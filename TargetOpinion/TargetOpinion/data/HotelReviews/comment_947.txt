No Eurostar bad luck not my problem

The staff and management of this hotel would not attempt to help my wife and I in any particular way.We were stranded due to a fire in the Euro tunnel and with no flights available and all car ferrys to the continent fully bookedwe were stuck in England.We spoke to the Duty Manager to inform her of our situation and were told that it was not their problem and we would be paying in full for a room we could not use but could be resold.We have also sent several e-mails to the General Manager none of which have been replied to. We would've gladly stayed on another date had this been offered.I dare say that after this review we will receive an e-mail from the G.M with an offer to stay but unfortunately it will be too little too late. As I am a concierge in one of londons top hotels and I know what good service is I will not be staying in this hotel in the future and will not be recommending this hotel to my guests or fellow concierge in London.
