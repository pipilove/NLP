An overrated hotel

I read reviews and am fairly adept at determing when people are overlycomplimentary or negative. Wow...did I miss it here. It was merely an adequate boutique hotel in a fabulous location. We have stayed in Paris several times and were specifically looking for a hotel near theArch D'Triumphe. I e-mailed with the hotel and was assured that our upgraded room would be large...we could barely put our luggage in the room and no room to move around. We upgrade to a junior suite thatwas laughable. The furniture appeared to have been bought at a yard sale. There are numerous 3* hotels in all the surrounding streets to select from. The breakfast was expensive, 12euro per person for a continental breakfast.Yohan who seems to have his own fan club is typically officious French. We had fun trying to get him to smile. He did provide some suggestions but it was a challenge!If you want the same area and rating, I would check out the Princess Caroline next door.
