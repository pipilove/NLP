Not Majestic At All (Awful Hotel)

My experience with this hotel was terrible; I've booked and paid a superior room and they assigned me a classic room which is extremely smaller than superior room and when I spoke to the front desk personnel he replied to me with a silly answer that superior rooms has some bigger rooms and other rooms are smaller! How deceive someone can be!Relating to their treatment; the Hotel front desk was rude, inhospitable and unfriendly.Finally, I don't recommend anyone to stay at the Majestic Hotel because of its overpriced rate and don't be deceived by the luxurious looks of the lobby because their rooms are really awful.
