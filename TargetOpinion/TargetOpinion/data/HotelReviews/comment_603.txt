Probably Not Your Best Choice

Our first trip to Berlin, so we were unfamiliar with the city layout. But we were drawn to the design of the Art'otel. Yes, the public spaces are nicely designed, as are the rooms. But the rooms are small and not very functional. And the location is definitely out of the way (although there is an U-bahn station just a half block away). And we were really put off by the tourist buses and groups. Not really our scene. If you do end up here, be sure to specify a room at the back of the hotel. The ones on the front are very noisy.
