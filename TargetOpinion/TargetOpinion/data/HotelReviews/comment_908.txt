not for business!

nice hotel, but don't stay here unless you don't care not to receive your faxes in time, or if telephones are transfered to the wrong room (if you are the unlucky one to have the same family name as another guest...) better stay at the Plaza Athenee or Meurice! splendid service overthere!
