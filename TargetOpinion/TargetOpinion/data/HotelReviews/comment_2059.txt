Overpriced

We stayed at this dump in May after coming across it online. It look beautiful on the web and we were so excited because it seemed like an inexpensive (129$) boutique hotel. Sad to say, it turned out to be a disappointment. Stay if you have to, but don't expect to enjoy it. From reading about the hotel you get the impression that it is something extraordinary. It's not.The hotel is very basic and run down. I cleaned myself the bathroom, it was really in need of renovation. Our biggest complaint was the uncomfortable bed with worn bedding. The carpet was old and frayed. The TV reception was limited. We didn't want to risk using the tea facilities. They were cheap on towels and provided no soap, shampoo was not replaced.Also, don't count on the breakfast, which consisted of watery coffee and dry toast. Location is good if you want to party, otherwise it's too far from the harbour. Comparatively this is a overpriced hotel that doesn't really deserve any attention. I'm not the sort of person that write a review but after this I'll be glad if this puts someone off going there. What was otherwise a lovely stay in a pleasant city with nice people was marred by this below mediocre hotel.
