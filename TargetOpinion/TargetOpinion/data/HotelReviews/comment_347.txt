Not bad, not great

My partner and I stayed here for a long weekend. In the past we have usually taken the cheap pension option in the centre of town and I have to say having tried a five star option, I would sincerely recommend the pension downtown. You are a bit detached from the buzz of the city in the harbor and you don't really get a feeling for a place as alive as Barcelona in a five star luxury hotel. The goods are, the place is nicely decorated, Bose sound systems etc. The staff at reception are very nice. The restaurants are a bit pricey but excellent. Just what you would expect form a top flight hotel.The bads, we had a couple of issues with them messing up our room service lunch and brining the wrong dishes. They eventually replaced the wrong dishes but it meant we had our starters after our desserts. At 120 Euro for lunch a good hotel would have taken the whole thing away and delivered us what we asked for. Finally, they did not replenish the coffee making facilities for the 3 days we stayed, had to keep phoning them for coffee.All in all nothing major wrong or right but I just didn't click with the hotel like you do with others.
