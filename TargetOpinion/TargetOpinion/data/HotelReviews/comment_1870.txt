Like Fawlty Towers

From the moment we arrived (when no-one bothered to take our bags from the taxi) to the moment we left, there was nothing but hassles.Our booking (made 3 months prior) was incorrect as they had us staying for one night not two, and then told us we would have to move rooms during our stay.Despite breakfast being inclusive, it was placed on our bill (despite checking with reception and with the restaurant)We were overcharged in the bar, and when this was pointed out, were told NOTHING COULD BE DONE ABOUT IT!!! (they soon got the message).Staff seemed totally inept.Even checkout took 20 minutes due to a long queue at the reception desk.Complaints fell on deaf ears.Nice hotel, great location, dreadful service
