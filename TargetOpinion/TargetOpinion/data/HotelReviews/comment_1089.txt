Loved the Langlois

We booked the Langlois after reading many positive reviews in Trip Advisor, and were not disappointed. We were given room 31, which we were quite happy with, especially with the artwork and the ceramic cat on the fireplace. The bathroom was the size of a small bedroom! Our stay did not include breakfast, so we walked down a few stores to the left to the Artisan Boulangerie and had an almond croisant for breakfast, which was a meal in itself. Many of our wonderful lunches came from that Boulangerie, but we were disappointed to find them closed on the weekend. We had 2 good, reasonably priced meals at Chartier, a 5 minute walk from the hotel, and 2 wonderful meals at Bistro de deux theatres at 18 rue Blanche, a 2 minute walk. All the hotel personnel were nice, especially since we tried to speak French as much as we felt comfortable doing. The Trinite metro station at the end of the block was a quick way to start our local travel. But walking around is the best way to get a feel for the charm of Paris. When we return, we definitely will choose the Hotel Langlois as our base.
