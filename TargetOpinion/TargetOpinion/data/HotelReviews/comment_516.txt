Average hotel at great location

We chose this hotel on the basis of the location and the reviews in TripAdvisor.The location is excellent. In the middle of everything, very close to La Rambla and Placa Catalunya. Spot on.Otherwise there was nothing special in this hotel.The hotel was art deco style - we have nothing against it, but there was nothing special in the interior that would have warmed our hearts.The room was OK, but again nothing that would make me long for this hotel.The bed was average and OK, but with these room prices I would have assumed a higher level of quality. Still OK.What was not at all OK was the soundproofing of the rooms.The exerior walls and the windows let all the street noise in - including louder conversations of passer-bys.Also the in house noise of the bar (clings and clangs of the glasses) three levels down continued late and was clearly audible inside the room. Fortunately we were so exhausted of walking the lovely streets of Barcelona that we fell instantly asleep. But if you have any trouble with your sleep think what I just wrote above.Breakfast was OK.The staff was OK as well, but again there was nothing that would make me say they were particularly friendly. Summa summarum: excellent location - bad soundproofing - everything else average.
