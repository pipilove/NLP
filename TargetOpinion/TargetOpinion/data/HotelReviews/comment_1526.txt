Great Location and Value

We were here for the Easter long weekend and loved it. We received a very fair rate and the staff at the front desk were very helpful and they even had a free shuttle to downtown which we only used on our first night becuase we soon realised just how close we really were to everything. we were about a 25 minutte walk to Pioneer Square about 15 minute walk to Pike Place Mareket and a 20 minute walk to Space Needle / EMP. The rooms are clean and well kept with a mini fridge in the room that I really like, but sadly no coffee maker. My only major beef was the $21 for nightly parking which was a blatant rip-off considering they only charge $8 to park all-day.
