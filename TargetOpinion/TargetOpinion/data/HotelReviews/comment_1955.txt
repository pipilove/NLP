Dull Dull Dull

What can I say the hotel was very very DULL indeed. Certainly not a 5* star hotel. Although the hotel has a great location - if all you want to do is shop. The hotel lacks any personality at all. In fact I would say that the hotel is missing something - it felt cold and clinical. The rooms are very clean but basic. The bathrooms are large and functional. The lack of towels (1 per person), changed under duress. The only reading matter in the room was a TV Guide - no Where magazine or map.The front desk staff where efficient - very Swiss but with little or no personality. As for the concierge every request was a chore. As we were there for a week it was a bit of a lottery which one of us asked the question - the loser had to ask.Not a hotel I would return to.
