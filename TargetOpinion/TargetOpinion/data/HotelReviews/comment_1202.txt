Free Wine at the Rex

The Rex is centrally situated near Union Square and easy to find. The bedroom was well appointed and spacious but could have done with air-conditioning. We had breakfast in the adjoining restaurant once, but as it was a little pretentious with a limited menu we preferred to go to Lori's Diner a few doors along the street. The staff were all very friendly, especially the barman who was both knowledgeable and interesting to talk to. There was a free glass of wine each evening in the bar, which also provided some musical entertainment some nights. The lounge bar was a very pleasant place to sit and go over the day's events.
