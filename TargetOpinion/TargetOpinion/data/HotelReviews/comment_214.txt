Kudos to Nadia Hotel

We stayed at the Nadia 1 night before we went on Safari and then another 2 nights on return. They not only stored some of our luggage, but also had a Welcome Home bouquet for us on our return from Africa. The manager and his staff are extremely friendly and helpful and make every attempt to make your stay in Amsterdam memorable. The location is great with a bus and tram stop less than a block away. Many rooms face the canal. We were in Room 413 which was delightful. Breakfast is included and is in a bright, airy flower-filled room; coffee and tea service are provided in your room. Even though this is a budget hotel, it is clean and is a great value, with many amenities. Yes, there are steep steps, but they provide much needed exercise for most of us. (There is always someone there to take your luggage up and down from street level.)
