Surprised by all the great reviews

We stayed at the Hotel de Londres Eiffel in late May 2006. Our room was on the main floor , and the doorway to the dining area was immediately adjacent to our room. This door banged shut all evening long and then started up again in the morning when the dining area opened up. Our only encounter with the management / staff / owners was when we asked if we could possibly change rooms - we were told NON. No help whatsoever. We noticed that the owners(?) seemed very friendly with all the American guests - however being non-American - we also seemed to be 'persona non grata'. In fact - we couldn't say if they were the owners or not - because they simply ignored us completely. I would have thought it was us - but some other non-American guests commented on the same thing and said that since the hotel is listed in Rick Steve's books - the owners are definitely catering to Americans. We were on a round the world tour and this was the only time we ever felt anything less than welcome anywhere. Despite this - we loved our stay in beautiful Paris and loved the location of this hotel.
