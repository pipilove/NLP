Nice weekend spent out of the hotel

My wife and I spent a weekend at the Westin St Francis in Feb 2003. We were very happy with the rate booked via Expedia, however upon check-in, we were presented with an upgrade (SPG Elite) to a room with street view overlooking Union Square. Well, I believe they ulitmately put us in a parlor room with a 1 or 2 foot view of the square. The room was set too far back and the view was blocked by the building itself. The Westin Heavenly bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was large enough for 2 to get ready in the morning.The staff was fine, valet was a bit slow, and parking was very expensive ($36 per day). I would return to San Francisco, however I would probably stay at a different hotel in that area.
