The reviews did it justice!

Our stay was an excellent experience. The hotel is clean, comfortable and staff extremely helpful.We arranged a mini-bus for our return journey from Beauvais airport, which was eventful, but great to be dropped at the door and not have to search for the hotel. Having said that there is a Metro stop only a minute away.Our trip on the Seine for dinner was worth every penny, food and entertainment were both great.The hotel recommended a restaurant next door for lunch the day we arrived, it too was very enjoyable and a great way to start a break in Paris.
