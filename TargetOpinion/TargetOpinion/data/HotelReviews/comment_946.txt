Good location, nice decor, hot water problems

Good points:very very central locationvery nice decor (much better than many hotels I've stayed at in Paris)Breakfast was good enough (with English newspapers as well)Good rate via laterooms.com at 150Euro per night.Bad points:I was on the 6th floor and with the windows open it was noisy, but expect that for central Paris.No air-con. I suspect the rooms will be very hot in the summer.NO WATER in the morning!! This happened twice!Reception greeting on arrival - the guy behind the desk was very miserable. However, other receptionists were very nice.
