Fantastic Hotel

I stayed at this hotel for a friend's hen weekend, and was very impressed. It is easy to get to the hotel from the airport, and is in an ideal location for shops, bars etc.The rooms were fairly small (without being cramped) but had everything you need. The bathroom was cleverly designed with glass walls to make the room look more spacious - but there is a curtain to draw around the glass!!The buffet breakfast was the biggest I have ever seen, and all the food was of exceptional quality.The only thing I could find fault with was the shower, which kept going hot and cold. Other than that, the Park Inn is a fantastic hotel to stay in.
