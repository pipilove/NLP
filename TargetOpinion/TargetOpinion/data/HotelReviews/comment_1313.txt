Good experience

We stayed at The Omni in San Francisco for 3 nights while we went on a wine tour in Sedona. The service was good, the rooms were fine, and it was an overall good experience. I have stayed in nicer hotels, but this was in a good location to sight seeing and shopping. The rooms were quiet and the beds were confortable enough. We did, however eat at the restaurnant downstairs for dinner and breakfast and had some issues. The food was good, but the service was not. Waiters were slightly rude and one night at dinner we had to go find the hostess to be seated. We stood there for over 15 minutes. Across the street there is a stop for the trolley and the bellman was good about helping us hail taxis. One night they even had the hotel car take us to the pier for our alcatraz tour. Overall we had a good experience at this hotel and would recommend it to others.
