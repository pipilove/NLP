Small with NO Air Con

The hotel is in the middle of downtown which is great if you are looking for the downtown city life and not the cute charm of San Fran. The hotel's curbside passenger loading parking was full which made check in a pain because it is located on a very busy street. Once in the check-in was fine. The room however was very small and the bathroom was Tiny. The decor was nice but it looked more like a surface renovation than a deep clean renovation. New Paint, and some trendy decor doesn't change the overall feel or quality. Pillows were horrible and left me with a neck cramp the next day! The worst part of the hotel is that it doe not have any air conditioning! again, no air conditioning. Being that san fran is usually cool you wouldn't think it would be a problem, but when we open the windows the street noise was so loud we could not sleep, and with the windows shut it became very stuffy. Seriously, what kind of hotel does not have air. I had a different hotel booked the next night and called them at 8am the next morning and they let me check in early because I couldn't even imagine getting ready in the tiny bathroom at the Chancellor. My husband and I could barely fit in the bathroom at the same time and we are very small people! No counter space either. My advice is book a hotel in an area with more charm, unless you want to be downtown, then i would suggest a hotel with Air conditioning! I do not recommend this hotel. save your money.
