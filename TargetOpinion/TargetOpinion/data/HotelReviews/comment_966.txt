Charming Parisian Hotel

We had a wonderful stay at this hotel. This was my first trip to Paris and wanted a place that was close to everything, but would also provide a good neighborhood vibe without feeling to touristy. The hotel is located directly across from the Pantheon, a gorgeous neoclassical building. Its an approx. 7 minute walk to the metro and several great cafe's are located a block away. This metro stop (Luxembourg) was very convienent for getting around Paris and seeing all the attractions, and also provided direct transport to the train station and airport. The rooms were small (we're from NYC so this didn't bother us), very clean, well kept and we loved the parisian decore. The hotel was unique with lots of charm! Amenities we used included hotel safe, minifridge, hairdryer, soaps, breakfast cafe, concierge. The staff was very helpful- provided wine glasses for us to drink in our rooms and called a restaurant for us to make reservations (since we don't speak French). I will definitely come back and will stay here again. Best of all, the rates can't be beat for the atmosphere, quality, cleanliness, and location.
