Excellent Hotel

Before we stayed here, I read all the reviews posted and decided that the best bet was to ask for a room on a higher floor to avoid the noise form underground trains. When we arrived we were given a room on the 7th floor anyway so no need to ask. Sitting in the bar on 2nd floor the noise from the trains was evident, but not overpowering. Ask for a room on a higher floor but don't worry if you don't get it.Other reviews mentioned the street noise, as far as I could see all the rooms had windows that opened into a central courtyard. With the window open you can hear the street noise even on the 7th floor. However close the window and it was completely silent. All rooms have Air con so there is no need to have the window open. Right thats the practicalities out of the way. The hotel it's self was very central and really well presented. The style is contemporary but not minimalist. The beds were huge and very comfortable. I have stayed in many mid range hotels in cities, and for the rate this has to be the best.Do yourself a favour and stop looking for a hotel in Barcelona, you have just found it!!!!
