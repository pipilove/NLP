not first class, service lacking

The hotel staff was generally unhelpful. Rooms look worn and bed linens are not changed on a daily basis. Soap was never replaced during my 5 day stay (they were too small to begin with and I only received one small one for bath and sink). It was a huge struggle to get a nice room, rooms were in need of repair. Not a 5 star hotel in any way.Would not stay again.
