doesn't honor reservation's price

Made a reservation using the 50% Entertainment book discount (mentioned at time of reservation) and when we went to check in, they said they haven't honored that for weeks. So we cancelled the room before we found out that there was a huge convention in town that took over all the hotels in the area, and we had to cut our vacation short. The Warwick apparently thinks a few bucks (from milking conventioneers) is worth ticking off a few Entertainment book users. Definitely not 3 star material to me...pretty sleazy IMHO.
