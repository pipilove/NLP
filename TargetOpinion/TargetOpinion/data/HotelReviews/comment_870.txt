Decent design hotel - bit too sparse

Stayed at the Lux as part of a group booking for friends attending a launch party in the City. The hotel staff were great, the breakfast is a good buffet with delicious croissants. The beds are not true king size but are ok for a couple and perfecly comfortable. Very design magazine looking room but white walls inevitable get scuffed.The bathroom is a design feature which I personally wouldn't choose, but the shower is great, loads of pressure and aboth overhead and handheld. It is open to the room but unlike other reviewers I think if you have issues with your partner seeing you in the shower thats your problem not the hotel.Location is good, Mitte is a great hub to get to everything, there is a U-Bahn and S-Bahn within a couple of minutes walk, and the best boutique shops are just round the corner. No cleaning daily but towels changed which is fine.Overall good for a weekend stay but wouldn't pay their rack rates.
