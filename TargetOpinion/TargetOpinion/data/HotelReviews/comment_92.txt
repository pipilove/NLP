Grand Disaster

A friend and I stayed here in late July/Early August 2007. How, why and where this hotel gets its reputation for being a Grand Hotel is beyond me. The carpets are stained and smell through out the hotel - and smell of must and damp. The Bedroom was akin to something you might find in a 2 star hotel in London with old chipped furniture and the saloon style swing-door on the bathroom was cheap beyond belief. My friend found a small cockroach in the closet as we were leaving - which is just as well as had we known about them our stay would have been far more unpleasant than it already was.All in all, a shabby hotel resting on a reputation undoubtably earned many decades ago. Avoid.
