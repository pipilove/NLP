Good standard value without frills

Good standard Mercure hotel; well located within walking distance of the Mitte business and govt district and the restaurant and bar areas of Oranienburger Strasse. Very competetively priced, like most Berlin hotels. A no-frills chain product; can be recommended without second thoughts.
