Absolutely Perfect

Mu husband and I have stayed a number of times at the Sheraton on the Park Sydney. I cannot say enough about how lovely this hotel is. The service is wonderful with friendly courteous staff, rooms are spacious and beautiful and the hotel is very central to everywhere. Bathrooms are very large and comfortable. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.
