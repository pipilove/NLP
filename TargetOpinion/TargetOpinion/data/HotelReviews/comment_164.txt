3 stars hotel, 5 stars location

The room was specious and very clean. However, the furniture  carpeting needs refurbishment.The hotel has a 5 star location in the centre of Amsterdam. 3 min. walk from central train station and a few min. walk from Dam squareThe room service menu and hotel restaurant was a real disappointment.The internet rates are incredibly expensive 5 euro for 1 hour, 20 for a day, 88 for a week.
