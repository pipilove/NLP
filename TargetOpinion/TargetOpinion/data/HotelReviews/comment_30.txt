just perfect

this hotel is truely the best in amsterdam and an enjoyable place to stay. This is the 3rd time my wife and i stayed there and this time was flawless as usual. We had a big room and our own little private terrace with private entrance, our 3 pound little dog just loved it and felt like home immediately. The staff is just great and they bend over backwards to assist, i honestly cant find anything bad to say about the pulitzer and staff given the price/reward ratio. In fact by looking @ price/reward i find the Pulitzer to be in the highest category of 5 star hotels ive been to... truely a bargain. Location just cant be beat.... you want to be on prinzen/heren/kaiserstraat simply bcs its a true pictoresque neighborhood and best of all is close to everything and anything. This place is killer and happy to return shortly...
