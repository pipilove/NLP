Needs a refurbishment

When you book to stay in a four seasons you expect a minimum level of luxury and comfort in your stay. We stayed here as part of our honeymoon and i can safely say that the place lets the four seasons brand down and has made us question whether we will ever choose this brand again. It screams 1970's! This hotel was part of our honeymoon and if you are looking for somewhere special. This is most definately not the place for you,The only thing that i would say are true 5* are the breakfasts and the porters. Everything else is certainly not. The room was tiny we paid for a full harbour view which we got but the room smelt musty and the bathroom was tiny and not that great. The pool area was horendus. Really realaxing with a motorway equivilent that you can see whilst you are sun bathing and generally a shabby area.
