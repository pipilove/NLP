Typical Marriott

This hotel is a typical Marriott brand with wonderful service and nice big rooms, especially for European hotels. However, don't be fooled by the name City Center. This hotel is not as close as other hotels are to the tourist sites, so unless you are staying for business or you MUST use Marriott points, you should consider something closer. There are no stores or restaurants within a half a mile and the walk home from siteseeing in the evening is brutal. However, if you are comfortable using public transit the closest U-Bahn (Metro) stop is a 5-10 min walk. Some good points: quite at night, very comfy beds, good service, and very clean rooms.Some bad points: not the best location.
