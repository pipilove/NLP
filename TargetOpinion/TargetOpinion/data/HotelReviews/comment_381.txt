Better deals around the corner

I booked our hotel through Expedia for only 2 nights, just in case I didn't like the hotel. I'm glad that I did, too. I suggest that anyone thinking of staying here go around the corner (2 min walk) to Hotel Inglaterra. Here's why:1. Our hotel room was freezing cold, colder inside than out, it seemed. I called the front desk to make sure I was operating the A/C correctly and was instructed over the phone what settings to put it on. The room was still freezing the next day, so someone came up and told me that I had actually turned the thing off. I don't think either was correct because I tried every possible setting, the temp was as high as I could set it, and our room was cold the entire time.2. The wireless internet is expensive, 15 euro per day per computer. I paid for the internet and yet I couldn't get a signal. The front desk did rectify this problem by sending me up some big clunky antenna. It worked, but still annoying. When using a laptop, the less wires the better, right?3. The hotel room was very mediocre. It was not 4 stars and definitely not worth the price. The room was boring. I'm not super into decor or anything, but it was basically furnished like a Motel 6 or something. It was clean, but very basic. The television was old and didn't work properly.This hotel is not terrible, but it's just OK. I highly recommend going around the corner to Hotel Inglaterra, where I stayed for the rest of my trip.
