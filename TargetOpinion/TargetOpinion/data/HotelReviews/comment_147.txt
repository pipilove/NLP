No complaints about the Victoria Hotel!

Having read so many mixed reviews of this hotel I didn't know what to expect. However, I was pleasantly suprised on arrival at the hotel. The staff were helpful, the hotel extremely nice, and the location perfect. The only criticism was the size of the rooms, as they were very small. But what do you expect from a city centre hotel? This is the sacrifice you make for the location. And though the room was small, it was very nice. Overall, a very good experience of the hotel. It cost 230 Euros for two nights, which I think is good value for somewhere so central!
