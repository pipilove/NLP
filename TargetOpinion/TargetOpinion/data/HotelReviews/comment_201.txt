Hated it!

We stayed here in October 2002.The room we were given was on the top floor, we needed oxygen by the time we'd got up there! The double room we were given was dreadful, if one of us wanted to get in or out of the bathroom door, the other had to sit on the bed to make way. There was no light shade on the main light, the shower was a mere trickle and it was just generally dingy.Would rather stay at home than go back to the Nadia!
