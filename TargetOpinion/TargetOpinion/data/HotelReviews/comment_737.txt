Impressive hotel - great for big groups

Arrived late on a friday night having booked via the internet for 14 people. Because of the advance internet booking, we got a great rate for the hotel (97 Euros per night). However, this didn't include breakfast but that wasn't too much of a problem. I'd say buying breakfast separately is too expensive, especially when you can buy it round the corner for a better price. The hotel lobby staff were very polite and helpful and seemed to like working there. The hotel itself is fantastic - very new and modern looking with incredibly fast lifts. Although not very big, the rooms were along the same lines. They had the basics and were very comfortable. However, the cleaning staff seemed a bit too keen at getting into the room on a sunday (at 9am)!The bathroom situation is not as bad as some of the other reviews have made out. They are a bit strange (clear glass into the upper half of the shower cubicle  frosted glass toilet door) but there is a curtain to pull round the whole area. Even for those who don't know each other that well, it's not so bad. Probably the best features of the hotel are the view from the room window (assuming you're on a higher floor), the size of the hotel (it's easy to find), and the excellent location. It has to be in the best place for going out in the evening (restaurants, bars etc). I'd definitely stay here again and again if returning to Berlin!
