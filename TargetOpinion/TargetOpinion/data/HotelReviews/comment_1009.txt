Adequate

Six months ago we stayed at the Hotel Splendid Etoile in Paris based on the rating and reviews on the Trip Advisor web site. The hotel was better than the reviews.In planning another trip to Paris (Dec, 06), I consulted Trip Advisor to find a better rating for the Royal Magda Etoile. Although the room was clean, spacious and adequate, it was no more.The elevator was barely large enough for two adults WITHOUT LUGGAGE. The room had to be locked going in and out with a key, minor but a nuicance. There were no washcloths in the bathroom and none available. Closet space was minimal and there were no drawers. The furnishings and decor was quite basic. The internet connection was hit and miss, mostly miss. Ther was no full length mirror in the room. The windows all faced a small courtyard.None of these by themselves were big deals and our stay was comfortable and fine. However, for similar money in the same area, the Splendid Etoile is a far superior hotel.
