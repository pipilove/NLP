Adored Hotel Fita

We took our first trip to Europe in May 2006. Our last stop was 2 nights in Amsterdam. We booked the Hotel Fita based in large part on Trip Advisor reviews. When we arrived we were buzzed in by Hans, who turned out to be the owner along with his wife Lus. After several minutes of pleasant conversation we were shown to our room. It was gorgeous, large with a balcony and the largest bathroom we encountered during our eight nights in Europe. As we were getting settled in there was a knock on the door and there was Hans with a bowl of peanuts and champagne. As he suggested we stood on our balcony and toasted to our first night in Amsterdam.The location is great, near the museums, in a primarily residential neighborhood. Only 1 block away you can hop on a tram or bus. Restaurants and nightlife are within a 10 minute walk. Breakfast was wonderful, and as we were told, just follow your nose downstairs in the morning. We particularly loved the fresh squeezed orange juice, eggs and bacon. We were offered discounted tickets to the museums at breakfast. Exceptional service.Two nights were not nearly enough to see Amsterdam and enjoy the Hotel Fita.
