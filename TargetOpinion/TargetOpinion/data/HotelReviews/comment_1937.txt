Great location, average hotel room

We stayed here for a week at the beginning of August. We have stayed at other Four Seasons before so we were really looking forward to this part of our trip. The location was excellent for tourists, right beside circular quay. However, the room was quite disappointing. Small and dated. We have been to Sydney a couple times before and experienced rooms in the city to be quite small. However, we had expected more from the Four Seasons. So room was disappointing. I don't know if they were having a busy week or not, but the service was also only average. After the first night, I asked the front desk if an upgrade was available to a harbourview room (ready to pay the upgrade price). The desk said they will look into it and let me know. I told her we will be out for the day and expected to come back to some good news. Not only did we not get good news, we got no news at all. They never got back to me that day or any day of our trip. I decided not to bother following up as we weren't in the room too often anyways. However, the hotel was disappointing. The Shangri-La was right behind the hotel and seemed to tower over the Four Seasons as a newer, bigger hotel. I will try another luxury hotel the next time I am in Sydney.
