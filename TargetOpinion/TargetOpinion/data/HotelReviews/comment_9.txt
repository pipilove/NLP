Not a great stay!!

Stayed at the Pulitzer for business at the beginning of June 2005.The 'Executive' room I got was small and rather basic. Not even an internet connection!Breakfast for Euro 20 was OK!The location is great! But the service patchy!I do not believe it deserves to be in the 'Luxury Collection' of Starwood.Might be a good place for tourists, but try another place if you are in Amsterdam on business.
