Stay Away

We noticed a strong odor on the floor and my wife couldn't understand why she was suffering from breathing difficulty each night when we returned to the hotel. We later found out that the smell was mold (we suspected but it was later confirmed) due to a problem they had on the floor above with the sprinkler. It is hard to believe that a hotel placed guests on a floor knowing that there was a mold problem.The breakfast, which is 40 Euros (about $55 USD) is ok but I never rec'd the omelette I requested despite numerous requests.Bottom line, for the price there are far more reputable places to stay in Paris.
