Rather sterile, like we found berlin

The hotel is trendy in a minimalistic, clean sort of way. Perfectly adequate for overnight stays, but probably better suited to business professionals - who were dominant at breakfast, as it's not the type of place to lounge comfortably around in, especially as all the TV channels are in German and there's no mini-bar, kettle, or even drinking water in the room! The nearest tube/Ubahn station is a good 10 min walk - and about 4 changes from the airport - better to go to the Halensee S-bahn station which is only one change from the airport. We asked for recommendations to a lively cafe for lunch and had a 1/2 hour journey to find one (walk  tube). KaDeWe, the major dept store is on the Ku'damm, but right at the other end - 3 tube stops and a good walk.Overall the hotel matched our opinion of Berlin - sterile. If we'd been more impressed by Berlin, the hotel would have been fine as a base, but we found it a hard city to find any life in - perhaps we went at the wrong time of year?? We won't be back to find out. Recommend you go to Rome, Paris or Stockholm instead - much more to do, see and experience!
