Lousy Concierge and Desk Service

The hotel itself was adequate but I couldn't get passed the staff. When I asked questions they looked confused and asked me irrelevant questions in response. I can excuse people who are not completely fluent in English but not in a hotel front desk role. The Concierge was also disappointing. He responded in a quick hurried manner to my inquiry and wasn't genuinely interested in offering assistance. I may be too critical but these are important positions. These people are the face of the company and have the most impact on the clients impressions.
