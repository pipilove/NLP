Montecarlo, Barcelona-Decent hotel

I have just returned from my vacation to Barcelona, Spain. After thoroughly researching hotels in the area I decided to book with the Montecarlo, which based on reading other reviews, met my expectations. The hotel lobby was very nice, the room was small but clean and we had a great view of las rambla from our balcony. The location of the hotel was great since we were right in the center of the area, most of what we wanted to do and see was within walking distance. Generally the front desk staff were very helpful with suggestions for where to eat and go out etc. We never ate at the hotel since there were so many options so close by so I can't comment on the food there.The only dissapointment with the hotel was the Internet access which was limited-I was never able to open or send any emails from my hotmail account. Also remember to bring your own travel iron as the hotel does not have one.
