Last Minute Top Secret Hotel Hstorical Gendarmenmarket

Stayed at the 5 Star Hilton Berlin for two nights to experience the Christmas Markets and celebrate my friends birthday. We we allocated room 5088 which looked over an internal courtyard so very quiet but no view. Most importantly the room appeared clean and well maintained. The size of the room was adequate but the luxurious touches I would have expected from a hotel of this standard were in my opinion poor. There were robes (not very large, soft or fluffy) and slippers, small, thin towels (in fact my friends had to share a towel). King size bed (plus added squeaky springs) with two single duvets. Minimal tea  coffee (one cup per day) and mini bar. The room also had ironing facilites. There was a pool and spa but I don't have experience them. With last minute it was room only so no idea what the breakfast was like. The redeeming point was the hotel's location which was superb. If you can get a room at a good price I would stay here but if paying rack rate there are other hotels with far superior facilities available in Berlin
