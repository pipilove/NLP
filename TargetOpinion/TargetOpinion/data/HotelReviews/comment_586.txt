Style and luxury on the Ramblas

I have just come back from 4 nights at the 1898. I relied on the comments and ratings from Tripadvisor and they were spot on: The superior room is easily big enough for all but (possibly ?) the North American market, which does after all like things really BIG. The hotel bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept on. Normally I long to be back in my own bed, but this one was just perfectly comfortable - not too hard and not too soft. Very dark curtains means you can sleep all morning and not realise it! (yes, I did...)Dimming room lighting: bit of a gimmick, but very nice touch once you get used to itLinen was crisp and heavy cotton, and changed daily. Towels were changed twice daily (dont go here if you are an eco-warrior!)Shower and bath taps: I noted the comments on TA: its really not rocket science - there is one dial for temperature, one for shower/bath tap, and one for small shower head on sep pipe. There is no need for further instructions, IMHONoise: had a room overlooking ramblas (room 444). Could hear some noise through double glazing (occasional police siren, some traffic) but never enough to disturb or prevent sleep. Benefits of overlooking ramblas outweigh noise problem. If you're a VERY light sleeper, go for internal room. Spa and pools: superb. Dark cellar pool was atmospheric, roof terrace pool superb location with view of city. Roof terrace probably comes into its own in the summer months, though...Location: cannot be beatenDecor: stylish, modern, bit on the dark side, but it all works well together.Staff: Faultless. made restaurant reservation, confirmed my existing reservation, left note in my room to say they had done it. always courteous and polite. multi-lingual.Top tip: no need to get concierge to arrange a taxi - they ring for one and by the time it arrives, it already has several euros on the clock. Just walk 5 yards onto Ramblas and hail one - never took me longer than 30 seconds.
