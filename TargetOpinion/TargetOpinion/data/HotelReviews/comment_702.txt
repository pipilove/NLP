Good deal for a basic modern hotel

This is a basic, modern, no frills hotel. I just got back from a week stay there. The rooms are very clean and functional and the staff were pleasant and helpful. I have no real complaints except that the inroom safe had to be paid for on a daily basis which was a little odd (maybe its a German hotel thing)I got a great winter deal on the room but be aware the buffet breakfast (which is very good) is not included in the price and is Very expensive (16 Euros p/p). I would advise getting an inclusive deal or eating at one of the many local cafes which offered breakfast for a third of the price.Getting around Berlin is easy with public transportation very close by and the hotel is close to the more interesting neighborhoods of Schoneberg and Kreuzberg (maps are deceptive these areas are easily in safe walking distance of the hotel even though they appeared to be further away)Overall this hotel is fine for a basic safe modern hotel but don't expect much in the way of character.
