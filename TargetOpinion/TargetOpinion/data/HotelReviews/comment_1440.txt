Central hotel in San Francisco

Excellent location in down town San Francisco, right next to Market Street and where cable cars run from. Only issue is noise of police sirens at night: kept us awake despite being on 20th floor, maybe we were unlucky.Children really liked breakfasts there, though quite pricey.Rooms have everything you'd need given you are staying in a downtown locationSimon
