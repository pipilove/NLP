Excellent hotel

Could not disagree more with previous reviewer.My wife and I loved this hotel.We arrived at exactly 12.00 noon and were allowed to go straight to our room,3pm is the official earliest time. The staff were extremely helpful,the room was spotlessly clean and very quiet,a wide choice of complimentary breakfast is served until 11.30 am !!! at weekends,the location is very central-5 mins walk to nearest station and this is all for 75Euro/æ‹¢52.00 per room per night.We have stayed in some real dumps at twice this price!The staff will also look after your luggage on the last day if you have a late flight as we did so that you can make the most of the day without having to drag lots of luggage around town.We had a great trip to Berlin and this hotel is one of the reasons for its success.Top marks!!
