The Rex Hotel is the King

Have stayed at the Rex many times and always found the staff friendly, capable and a pleasure to deal with. Great location, on the edge of Union Square, theaters and Chinatown. And no hills to climb! The Rex is funky, fun and don't miss the afternoon wine hour. Special feature are the two suites on the top floor. Can accomodate four guest as both the bedroom and living room are quite large. And the suite contains 1 and 1/2 baths which certainly adds to the comfort. The computer room has two computers, a printer and is rarely busy - and it's all free.
