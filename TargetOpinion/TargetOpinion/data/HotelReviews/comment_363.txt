What a sad excuse for a hotel...

This place is well past it. It may have cut it a few years back when Barcelona was one of the poorer European cities, but these days it has been left behind by a crop of much better and trendier places, actually located in town !A lump of concrete with some expensive shops does not equal a good hotel. Maybe in Baghdad I would accept this fake and soulless place and be happy that I was safe from bombs, but in central Barcelona (please note this hotel is nowhere near central), I have a choice of at least five better places.The hotel really needs to pick its act up as younger rich people are looking for more than over priced drinks, non-speaking Catalan staff and signage (Barcelona is the capital of Catalunya), and general drabness of this god awful place. The last time I went there I hoped I would never be unfortunate enough to return. I will remember this more clearly next time. Lastly, working girls may keep the (current roster of) business types happy, but the market has moved on, and it would be highly suggested to get out and look at some leading places such as : Malmaison, Hotel du Vin and Sofitel, which yes do charge your sort of high prices, but do deliver an exceptional service, not some drab pastiche of international travel that is no longer acceptable in 2006. I can only conclude that anyone who actually 'likes' this place has very little idea of what a leading venue should have to offer.
