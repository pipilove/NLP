It was great!

The hotel was lovely and the staff was outstanding. Every part of our stay here was pleasant. We arrived earlier than expected (nearly 2 hours before we were scheduled to check in) and they had our room ready for us anyway. They took our bags to our room and made sure we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. After unpacking we realized the comforter and pillows were down and we're both allergic to down. I called the front desk and asked for non-down blankets and pillows. Not five minutes later they were at our door.The room was very nice - very clean and had all the ammenitites we could ask for. We thouroughly enjoyed our stay at the Orchard Hotel and will be staying there later this year when we return to SF.
