Excellent hotel

Got a great rate for this hotel on hotwire ($195 per night) so was really pleased to be staying here. This hotel is about a 10 min walk from the Dam square in the center of Amsterdam, right on the canal. We got upgraded to a canal-view room (#175) which was small-ish (in the european style) but had high ceilings and a balcony and got sent some complimentary champagne for our honeymoon. No coffee or iron in the rooms - but all arrived on request. For a lovely breakfast, turn left out of the front entrance - on the next corner is a cafe with fresh baked breads and cooked meals. The porter organized a car service to the airport for a lower price than a taxi (E35). Highly recommended, nothing to complain about here.
