5 Stars Not Enough

It is hard to do anything but add praise to Hotel Arts Barcelona. It is the finest hotel we have ever stayed in. Our 26th floor suite overlooked the Port Olympic Marina, and the Mediterranean Sea. It wasn''t until we checked out that we were even told about our upgrade. 5 Stars were not enough to describe ouir experience.Service was amazing. We were there for 7 days, and after the second day, many of the staff knew us by name. On our second day without luggage thanks to Iberia Airtlines, the young lady in Guest Relations took pity on us, and sent a complementry bottle of Cava to cheer us up, followed up the next night with a selection of tapas. We only had breakfast at the hotel, which was outstanding. The rest of the day we were out and about enjoying Barcelona, the most vibrant city we have ever been to. One block walk takes you to the Metro, and from there, you are minutes away from everything, or you can stroll to Las Ramblas in 30 minutes, mostly along the beach. There is also a plethera of fine restaurants and clubs of all types and at the hotel doorsteps.
