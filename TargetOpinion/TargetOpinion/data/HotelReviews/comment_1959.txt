Good stay at the Swissotel

We stayed at the Swissotel for 6 nights in late November.It's well-situated - only one block away from Town Hall station and an easy walk from Darling Harbour and Circular Quay. There was a building site next door, but we had no experience with noise from this.The staff were very polite and helpful, and the room was lovely. A good size room with a king-size bed which was very comfortable. I slept very well there! The bathroom was a good size. All very clean and pleasant.We didn't eat at the hotel or have a drink there - we had breakfast just over the road in the cafe, which was lovely. The bar seemed very popular though.Some people have complained about having to get 2 lifts to their room... this is really not a problem and shouldn't put you off! There's no need to find your way through a shopping centre first as some seem to have suggested!All in all, a very comfortable stay!
