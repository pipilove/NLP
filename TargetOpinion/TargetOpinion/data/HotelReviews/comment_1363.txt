Amazing Find!

I stayed at this hotel because of a booking on Priceline. I got a GREAT price on the hotel and was extremely happy with the hotel. First, it is in a fantastic location - blocks from Fisherman's Wharf and within walking distance to so many things! Right from checking in, the staff was unbelievable! Every single staff member we came into contact with was extremely helpful and very nice! The room was on the smaller side but there was definitely enough room for two of us. The coffee, tea and biscotti in the morning is very nice. I would highly recommend this hotel!!
