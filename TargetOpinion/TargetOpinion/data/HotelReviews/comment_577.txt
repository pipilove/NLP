A Decent Stay

My partner and I stayed here recently for 2 nights and enjoyed the hotel (booked it primarily because of the great reviews on tripadvisor). As for our experience, the hotel seemed quite new, which usually means a clean and modern decor, which we found to be true. Although our room itself was a bit small for a superior room, it was sufficient for our purposes. The room was equipped with free wifi access, an LCD tv (but with only one english channel, no movies or DVD), a minibar, safe  stand-up shower/ bath. Didn't use room service so I can't comment on that. The decor was quite cool and on the funky side, definitely comfortable. The spa facility was only basic and as such, I wouldn't recommend it (poor changing  lounge area, small but neat looking pool with unisex sauna / steam and a couple of treadmills to account for a gym). We had a massage which was okay but not remarkable. Overall, the price is reasonable for what's offered and we would consider staying here again. I'd suggest this hotel is a solid 3 1/2 star (would be a 4 if they took some of the details up a notch).
