Nice hotel - won't be going again though

The hotel was nicely decorated and so too were the rooms. Initially, a new receptionist mistakenly gave us a smoking room but the very capable and pleasant assistant general manager Laura rectified this problem the next day.The second room we had was really noisy because the inconsiderate people in the next room continually had their loud air-conditioning units on all day and all night.Someone attempted to get into our room at 4:20am on night and fortunately we had our deadbolt and chain on the door. This kind of security issue must be a regular problem because there is a rather large section on safety  security in the room directory and warnings on the card that they give you with your key cards in. Following the hotels guidance about dealing with a security issue, we reported the incident immediately with the front desk. The gentleman who answered spoke little English and clearly didn't really understand what we were trying to say. My husband gave up and wedged two suitcases and a chair in front of the door too.The area (Fisherman's Wharf) can be unsafe at times. We spotted the usual pick-pocketers/bag snatchers hanging around the crossings in the area early evening time. They work in teams waiting for you to be distracted waiting for the walking man signal. If go to this area always be extra vigilant, also with street performers, again they are a distraction to you.We used to love San Francisco but we've decided we won't be going again. We were there for four nights/three full days and beggars must have asked us for money at least 100 times (I'm not exaggerating), it's bad.
