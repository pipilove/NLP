Pretty Average, NOT five star

We arrived in Sydney on short notice and being NYE most hotels were full. So the Amora, Jamison was not the first choice. But being five star and in the CBD, I thought it will do.Apon arriving I knew immeadiatekly it wasn't what you expect.No bell boy service. So carry your own bags to the room. When I asked about that the front desk said, oh you can go over there with your bags and see if they will help?!?!My wife and I have been traveling for over a month and have a lot of luggage, not just over night bags. So we were off to a bad start straight away.No one to take you to your room either - then the rooms were on the smaller side. Not very clean. Plenty of scuff marks and stains on the carpet.Dusty too.The television is small and in the wardrobe to the right of the bed, making it awkward to watch.Also the bathroom was ordinary and the towels small and light and ragged, as if they've been round the system for a few years. Arrrghhhh.This is just a few things I have mentioned. It's just not what you expect from a five star hotel.Perhaps four star hotel who isn't trying very hard, it might be that. But the rates for NYE and Jan 1st were out of this world...We will not be back.
