Reasonable place to stay in SF

We stayed overnight at the Castle Inn in San Francisco in November. It was a fairly convenient to Alcatraz Island and California Academy of Science in Golden Gate Park. We were looking for a reasonably priced  convenient location in SF that we did not have to pay for parking.  Very basic motel with comfortable beds, mini refrig and basic continental breakfast. It was within walking distance to quite a few restaurants (Miller's East Coast Deli-yummy!)  I did find that the clerk at the desk was rather unfriendly, though helpful. The free parking spaces were extremely tight for our mini van. The noise was not too bad, being only 1 block from Van Ness Ave.  If you are looking for a no frills, comfortable place to stay, Castle Inn was a good choice.
