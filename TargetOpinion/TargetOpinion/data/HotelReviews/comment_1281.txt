Very good value

I recently stayed at the Castle Inn and it was very good quality. Very friendly and helpful front desk.The rooms were very clean and the maid service was very efficient.Free breakfast was a nice touch.The area around the hotel is not bad, there are a few bars and restaurants. I can recommend the Chinese place around the corner( not the Thai place), it doesn't look much but the food was absolutely top quality.Within walking distance are 2 cable car lines, Lombard street and fishermans Wharf. Quality.
