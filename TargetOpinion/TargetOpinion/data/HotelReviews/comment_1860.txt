This was our first hotel in Australia. The pre-ordered limo whisked us in no time to the hotel. After the 20+ hour flight we felt like arriving in a haven of tranquility. A hotel like this is just what you want after such a trip. Sure this is no designer or 'boutique' hotel, but it is everything a good solid luxury hotel should be. Our room (executive suite) was superbly comfortable, with off course the wonderful Marriott bed and a good view of the harbour and opera house. From this prime position we watched the QM2 and QE2 glide into Sydney harbour. We took breakfast and evening drinks in the executive lounge, which made us feel very privileged. In our room we had wireless internet acces.My husband needed medical attention during our stay, this was organized with a minimum of hassle. Every staff member we had dealings with was courteous and efficient.I recommand this hotel and when I visit Sydney again I will certainly stay here again.
