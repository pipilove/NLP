Nice hotel, terrrible stay...

I'm usually very positive while on holiday, but this hotel let me down. The rooms were great and it all started out fine (except a bit dissapointing location...).The problems started on the second day when we were accused of breaking the bathroom-door. This made the rest of our trip unpleasant as some of the staff were very rude and kept coming to the room asking questions in a very accusatory tone. It made me feel very uneasy.The day of departure, we were refused to leave unless we left our home address and credit card number.We have since received a letter of apology, as their further investigations revealed that we had nothing to do with the damaged door, but our stay in Berlin was ruined. I only remember how unwelcome this all made me feel and how I could'nt enjoy myself because og the staff's behaviour.
