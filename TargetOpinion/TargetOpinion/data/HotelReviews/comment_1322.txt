People, see the comments!

We just wanted to tell you that this is an ordinary hotel which only has nice location. Read the comments. Those who rated Excellent mostly say location is good. Those with Terrible rateing bad experiences with staff. We stayed at this hotel with 2 kids in July. We requeted 2 beds through Expedia and it was confirmed, and they said only 1-king room was available. I showed the confirmation, but they did not honor. The front desk was not helpful so as the manager. Waisting our valuable time, we finally took it. Of course that room did not even have a view. It was my mistake that I expected little as we compromised bed type, but no. Again people, read the real comments. This hotel has bad reputation on staff!
