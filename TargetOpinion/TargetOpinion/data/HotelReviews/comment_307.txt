simply disappointed

I'm simply disappointed.maybe Majestic's management doesn't know what a Five Stars Grand Luxe means. this hotel should be a 4 stars, and I'm generous. I paid too much for the poor room I got (a superior, not a standard), che bathroom is a joke, small and not clean as it should be (some NOVOTEL 2 stars are more comfortable). breakfast is nothing special and everything is very expensive. swimming pool is not avaliable, and we weren't informed when we booked. 5 stars GL is the maximum rate for hotels. this one surely doesn't deserve it. NOT RECCOMENDED.
