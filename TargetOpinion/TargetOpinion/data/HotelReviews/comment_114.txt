Had to make a fuss

First room we were shown was extremely shabby  dirty plus the bed was extremely small  we had booked a queen size over the internet. I called reception  they were rude  unhelpful so my partner went down to make a fuss. We were shown a second room, a triple with a double  single bed  advised to push them together to make a queen size bed! As this was unacceptable to us we made more fuss and were eventually offered a club room upgrade. This room at least was 4 star standard but still had problems (the hairdryer did not work and the plug on the keetle looked unsafe). Despite the fact that the location was good I would not stay at this hotel again as the initial disagreement with unhelpful staff took the shine off the first day of our holiday.
