Renaissance Vendome - fantastic hotel

We stayed 6 nights at this hotel  it was fantastic. The first 2 nights we stayed in the deluxe room. This is a very small room so be prepared for it. We had 2 medium sized  one small piece of luggage. There was hardly any room to store them. We also were on the 2nd floor and found it fairly noisy late at night for about an hour or so because of the bar across the street. I guess they drag out the garbage bins  stuff at closing.We were able to switch rooms for the next 4 nights, still on the 2nd floor but room overlooked the courtyard of hotel. Very quiet. This room was a Prestige room  it was spectacular. Very large, bathroom has separate WC, tub  shower with ample storage space. Loved this room. Both rooms had very comfortable beds.Breakfast was included with our stay and it was really nice but I would not pay the 29 Euros or so that they charge for it.The location is fantastic. Only a couple of minutes walk to subway stop. Subway is very easy to use  2 euro for each ride or less if you buy a carnat of 10 tickets. There are a number of reasonably priced restaurants on Place du Marche Saint-Honore which is only a couple of short blocks from the hotel. There is also a laundromat on this street. We even did laundry while we ate one night at one of the sidewalk cafes.The staff are very professional, friendly  extremely helpful. One of the best trained staff we have experienced in our travels. They really try to make your stay the best it can be and then some. The concierge will purchase the museum pass as well as other things (Laduree macaroons being one) before your stay for a minimal charge.The Renaissance Vendome is a very good hotel in a great location. We would not hesitate to stay here again.
