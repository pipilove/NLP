Stay away !

Tried to book 4 double rooms, but he manager didn't want us at he the hotel. This is what he said: the problem with a group of people is that there is a chance that they might disturb the other guests, simply by talking with each other in the hallway, visiting each other in the rooms, etc. We are all 33 years old, and not a bunch of teenagers. We really wanted to stay at this hotel, so it was very sad that they didn't want us there.
