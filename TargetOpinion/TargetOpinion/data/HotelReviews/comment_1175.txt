Not all we hoped for

The Varenne was indeed clean, lovely and in a good location. However our room (a standard double for 120 euros a night) was small even by Paris standards and the bed was sub-standard. There was no hot water one morning and the breakfast was poor. After 8 trips to Paris I didn't think you could find a bad croissant, but the croissant and baguette I was served seemed as if they had been reheated after being frozen. And there are two excellent bakeries within a block! On the plus side, the air conditioning was quiet and effective, which can make a tremendous difference in the summer. The staff were polite and helpful. However, there are better deals to be had in Paris and we will probably not return.
