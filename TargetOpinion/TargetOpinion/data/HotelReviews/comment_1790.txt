Very clean. Great value. Great location.

I just spent a week on business at the Mediterranean Inn and was very, very happy with the experience. One of the things I really hate about most hotels is that often the rooms smell either like smoke or like cleaning fluid. My room at the Inn smelled clean, clean, clean. The decor is simple and cheerful with mission-style furniture, a big TV, and a comfortable desk and chair. Big very clean bathroom, plenty of hot water and towels. Nice little kitchenette. Not luxury, but very simple and comfortable. The hotel didn't seem very busy so I can't say what it would be like under full conditions, but my rooms was totally quiet with no noise from overhead or adjoining rooms. The lobby is warm and welcoming. The desk staff are some of the nicest I've ever encountered. They're naturally friendly and helpful without that trained-to-the-teeth faux friendliness you see at other hotels. My room on the 5th floor had a sweet little view of Elliott Bay and the rooftop deck has a stunning view. Right outside the hotel there are two grocery stores, a neighborhood movie theater and every kind of ethnic restaurant you could ever wish for. (Try Racha Thai and fondue dessert at the Melting Pot.) After work each day, I walked to the top of Queen Anne Hill and found a little park with a stunning view of Elliott Bay, the Space Needle, the city and Mt. Rainier.Getting to central downtown core is an easy 5-minute walk to the monorail right under the Space Needle. Only one thing I could wish for -- WiFi broadband in the room. C'mon, this is Seattle for goodness sake! There is cabled DSL and it's very reliable. All in all, I plan to stay here whenever I'm in the Emerald City and I'm telling all my friends.
