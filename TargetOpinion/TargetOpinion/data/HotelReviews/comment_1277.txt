not as friendly as these posts elude

Because of all the positive comments we had read here, we weren't too worried about our stay. Unfortunately, we were not very pleased. The place seemed a little run down and the staff was not friendly at all. The woman at the front desk didn't even greet us with a hello to us when we came into the front office...something you would expect if everyone proclaims they are friendly.In addition, when we met up with our friends and they helped us unload our luggage, the lady from the front desk ran out and confronted us about having extra people. We explained that they were our friends FROM SF there to show us around...only helping us carry our luggage. When we checked out the next day she yelled from the front office window at us, while we are on the street.... that she was charging us for extra people....and they did! However, only 2 of us stayed at the hotel!! So much for friendly staff! We've stayed in San Francisco before and I would recommend the Commodore Hotel or another Experience Rewards hotel in the SF area. Those were similarly priced, friendlier, and a better quality room for the money. I would avoid this place and would not go hear again.
