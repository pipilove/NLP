NOT recommended - unfriendly and arrogant

despite its hip surroundings and interior, lux 11 is not a place to recommend. problems started with a phone call enquiry where i was simply referred to the website for all information - the guy on the phone repeatedly referred me to the website with each question i asked. then there was a misquote on the price - a substantial sum but given lack of availability we had to take it. front desk staff were clearly annoyed with having to field innocent enquiries, did not make for a pleasant atmosphere. staff let themselves into the room late at night while room was occupied. then at check out there was an extended delay as they claimed we had not paid , which we had done so in advance. on discovering that we had we were offered no apology. NOT recommended! for the standard they boast, you are better off staying in a lesser star establishment where you will get better service. dont go there.
