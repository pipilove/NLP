What 5-star?

I booked online and got a great rate. Upon check-in, I was shocked at the room we received -- very stripped-down. It was like a 3-star hotel -- of the Quality Inn level. No amenities at all...there was one pump in the shower that was a body and/or shampoo. The towels were so thin and coarse. I was really shocked, and a bit disgusted. I asked to see the manager and she was polite was but did not acknowledge the problem until I became very specific about what I expect from a 5-star and what I am receiving. With a bit of insistence, she moved us into a 4+-star room. Here there were individual amenities, albeit cheap ones -- not luxurious by any means, robes, and the room just seemed genenally cleaner and brighter. I agree with another reviewer, that they have rooms for those that book a cheap rate and other rooms for those that pay the rack rate. At any rate, I have no idea how they can call themselves 5-star.
