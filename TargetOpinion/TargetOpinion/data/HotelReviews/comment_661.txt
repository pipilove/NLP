LOVE THE BERLIN MARK HOTEL

HI We have stayed in this hotel twice and are staying again later this year, for the value its great is this hotel, we had a 2 bedroom room for 125 euro a night including breakfast for 3 people, fab price, hotel in great location for ku dam and also for underground stations, hard rock cafe a few doors away and the breakfast is fab, busy but worth the wait, id defo say a good hotel for the money, only down side is no air conditioning, but open the windows its ok.
