Booked directly with the hotel, and had no problem at all.We had a reasonably early check in being late morning, and the room was ready. We were on the 5th floor and had a view of the Eiffel Tower which was great. The rooms are small, anc probably a little tired looking, but it was fine, but you are not in Paris for the room, but for the tourism, and the hotel is in a great place for that. very central to everything, and with a number of cafe's within a stones throw.Booked an evening dinner cruise through the hotel, and we couldn't have been any happier with it, absolutely fantastic.Had no problem with the staff, they all seemed freindly enough to me.If i had one gripe, i think that the rooms are over priced, but that's just me!!!!!!
