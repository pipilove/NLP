has location and ambience but pricey.

not pleased with some services Stayed here for 2 nights to attend a wedding. Although the ambience and style was nice for the wedding and reception and exactly what the bride wanted, I was not pleased with other services. Hotel was dark, guess that caters to the hip and trendy crowd.The cost of parking and drinks was ridiculous. Parking was twice the amount I paid even in Hawaii at an upscale hotel . Be careful if you have a promo code for discounted rooms, they did not work for us.I must say that the beds are comfortable as well as the pillows. On that note, be aware that they allow animals here. My son received numerous bites the first night. We were on the 14th floor but did not have a view as such, as we were on the north side of the hotel. Housekeeping discarded items that were not to be discarded even thou they were with the tux rental bags left on the bed. I agree with the other reviewer, eat breakfast at the Pike Place Market or even McDonalds at Westlake Center if your watching your pennies. But then again staying at The W is NOT watching your pennies. If I ever have to stay in Seattle again, I will not be choosing The W.
