Great Value and Very clean

We stayed here with my in-laws and my 14 mo old son in a family suite. It was very spacious and the refrig and micro were great to have. The free continental breakfast was enough for all of us.(Donuts, crossants, danishes, muffins, bananas, and apples.) The parking is tight but doable. We had a room on the top floor and found it very quiet. The owners were very friendly. I have stayed at high end hotels and the only difference is you pay for a beautiful lobby. I don't care about a lobby. Some of the rooms in expensive hotels are more outdated and worn than the rooms here. I found them to be very clean and up to date. I can't find one thing wrong with this hotel. The location is good, but a 20-25 minute walk or so to Fisherman's Wharf. I would stay here again, especially when traveling with family or kids. Call directly for best pricing and for Sr. and AAA discount.
