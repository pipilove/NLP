Style over Substance

This was undoubtably the most disappointing, but not the worst, hotel I have ever visited. It touts its style and free bar but falls down on the basics. The rooms on the ground floor, we were lucky enough to catch two of them, are literally 2 metres from the pavement and three from the trams. Despite the double glazing there was far too much noise from both outside the hotel and inside from the reception area.The rooms themselves were constantly gloomy and the hotel doesn't seem to be able to afford lighting above 25 watts. One room, 008, is so small the wardrobe door only opens 45 degrees and the bathroom is so small you have to sit on the toilet sideways! The water is constantly boiling and with cold water taps in the shower that slowly turn themselves off, it makes for interesting bath times.The breakfast is merely adequate, not what you expect at 210 euros per person per night. There is a free bar and 2 computer terminals that are free to use but that in no way makes up in the deficencies of this hotel. Most of the small team of staff are pleasant, the leas helpful being the Genaral Manager who showed no interest in offering an alternative room. If you haven't booked, don't, there are far better hotels in this price category, if we hadn't paid in full before arrival we would have walked out, something I have only done once before in neraly 30 years of travelling on business and pleasure.
