our stay at chancellor

After reading all the positive reviews on the Chancellor we decided to try it. We signed up for the family suite package as we were traveling with a child. Our one main criticism that actually made us leave was that there were no appropriate channels on the tv for kids, no vcr and no way to hook one up. I realize other people may not care about this but after a busy day of sightseeing, we like to relax and watch TV and we couldn't. I was surprised that there was no Disney channel or Nick or Cartoon network or any child friendly channel when they called it a family suite. It was also a bit too noisy for us as there was a street performer just under our window. We also had requested a refrigerator which was confirmed at least twice but when we got there we never got it. We moved to the Hyatt Embarcadero which all around was a better fit for us.
