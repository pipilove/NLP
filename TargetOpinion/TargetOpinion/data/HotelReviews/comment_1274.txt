The lady need to adjust her attitude!

This is a MOTEL, not a HOTEL. Do not expect too much. The bed is comfortable, bathroom is clean, location is not bad. These are the plus for this place. However, we were not pleased due to the following:(1) The wall is very thin and you can hear the coughing of neighbor room very clearly, not to mention if they are talking or watching TV or something else. Unluckily, our room has a connecting door with another room, and this make it a door in the middle instead of a wall. It's like someone sleeping right beside your shoulder.(2) This motel advertise complimentary breakfast, however, they really wish you don't go there to touch it. If you happened to bring food up for your room members, they will watch you like a thief and that special tone of talking make you feel you are stealing their breakfast instead. Suggest to the owner: PLEASE DON'T PROVIDE COMPLIMENTARY BREAKFAST IF YOU CAN NOT AFFORD TO. OTHERWISE, BE A LITTLE GENEROUS!! The old lady really need to change her attitude.(By my standard, she is not qualified to work at front desk at all). So, don't just look at the ranking, make sure you are staying at a MOTEL, NOT a hotel. With the price we are paying, we can book better hotels for sure.They advertise to be the best kept secret, please do your own research before you go. We will NOT return!!
