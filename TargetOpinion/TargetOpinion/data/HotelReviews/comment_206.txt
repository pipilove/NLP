5th Stay at Nadia

This was the 5th time I have stayed at the Nadia Hotel, friendly staff, great central location for atttractions and lovely fresh flowers at the breakfast tables. The breakfast room can get a bit snug in the morning when the hotel is full and the rooms are a bit small with quite narrow beds, but this adds to the quaintness of the place. Over all a great little place - no doubt I will be back for my 6th visit!
