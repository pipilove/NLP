Better choices elsewhere

we booked a 5 night stay at the Sheraton on the Park and decided shortly after checking in that we would be moving -and did so the next day. The room was adequate. The front desk staff ran hot and cold - inconsistent and not very helpful. The concierge was uninformed and hence, not too helpful. We moved to the Quay West Suites.la.
