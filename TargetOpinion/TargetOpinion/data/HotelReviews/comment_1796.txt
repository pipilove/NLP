Excellent Hotel

Excellent hotel, perfect location, and wonderful staff. This hotel should be rated higher that it is on most booking sites. The price was very good and the service was excellent. The staff went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. We were able to walk to all of the must see places in Seattle. The trip may have been business, but the stay was a pleasure at the Mediterranean Inn.
