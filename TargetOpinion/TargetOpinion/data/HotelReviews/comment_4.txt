Nothing very five-star

Certainly a comfortable hotel and well located. But hardly five star. The grandly named Pulitzer Gym is a tiny, hidden room with a few exercise machines (attached to mostly unworking televisions). The hotel seems to nickel-and-dime everything, including the amenities that are offered to Starwood Preferred Guest Platinum members. An unhelpful front-desk clerk kept insisting -- repeatedly -- that a reservation didn't include breakfast, even though it was noted on the written confirmation. Double-billed for internet use, etc. Room service trays were left in the hallways for hours and hours.
