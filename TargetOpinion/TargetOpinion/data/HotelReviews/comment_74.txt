great location - poor hotel

Yes, the location is great, but that's all the positive comment this hotel gets. The room was very small, the furniture was very old, a rusted heating and a mini bathroom. It was very warm when we visited and it was impossible to turn on the airco because it made a terrible noise...so the room got so hot that we had a incredible headache in the morning. Never never again! I think this hotel used to be very nice, but now it is more than time for renovation!!!
