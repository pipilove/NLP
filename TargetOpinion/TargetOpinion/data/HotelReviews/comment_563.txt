New Year in Barca!

This trip was a special one as it was Mr Chucklers 40th birthday. Mrs C had taken care of all the bookings and on that basis I can only assume the hotel made it very easy for her!!!! Good communication throughout the enquiry/booking process I am reliably informed - I was delighted on arrival as it was a total surprise!We would recommend a taxi from the airport for a 'no fuss/bother' way to reach the hotel. Cost â‚¬30. Mrs C had organised a bottle of champers and it duly arrived shortly after going to our room.The hotel is perfectly located 5 minutes walk from Playa Catalunya  Las Ramblas. There was a metro station 100 yards from the hotel door - perfect for exploring the city.It was great to be so close but yet out of the hustle  bustle of Las Ramblas!Check in was friendly and our room was very modern and clean - a superb range of toiletries were available too. Mrs C had booked a room on the 6th floor, following other Trip Advisor reviews and in fairness the metro rumble did not bother us at all.We did not have breakfast in the hotel as there is so much choice close by and at much better prices!In reality we enjoyed the hotel as a place to sleep and freshen up as Barcelona has so much to offer - one criticism would be that we did not find the beds overly conducive to a good nights sleep.For us the Harbour area was perfect....beautiful walks and lovely street cafes  bars line this spectacular area.One bonus was that we were able to obtain tickets to see Barca playing, albeit against a 3rd division side in the Copa del Rey. The ground is easy to get to from the hotel using the metro and is a must see on any trip to the city.All in all we would thoroughly recommend the Jazz - it lived up to its reviews! There is a great cafe next door to it and El Raco restaurant is also recommended (turn right at the front door).
