great hotel

We had a great stay at this hotel. Joined the loyalty club and got some goodies in the room. the room was clean, average size for an european hotel. the location was good that it was central on Dam square, however we had a street facing room and sometimes the noise came in off the street. the front desk employees were very helpful.
