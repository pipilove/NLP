Utterly disappointed with the Swissotel in Damrak

Given the group's reputation and the rates, you can imagine our disappointment when my fiance  I turned up for a w/e break at the hotel to find the exterior of the hotel covered in scaffolding. Despite exchanging several mails with the reservations desk at the hotel, there was no mention of the fact that there would be builders present during our stay when we booked the room. We had specifically requested a superior room with a king size bed, so I was rather peeved to find that not only did our room have the picturesque view of a brick wall but that our king size bed was in fact two single mattresses pushed together. Upon mentioning this to the hotel staff, we were upgraded to a junior suite, although not before I was quizzed by a second member of staff as to why I wanted to move rooms in the first place. Her tone was offensive to say the least. Imagine our delight when at 7.15 the next morning, I found a couple of builders outside our window hammering away for Queen and country. The manager said he completely understood my feelings when I raised all these points with him but his contrition lasted all of two minutes. He offered to reduce the room rates by the pricely sum of â‚¬30 per night. There were no apologies and he certainly didn't appear to regret the fact that between his badly-trained staff and the builders, they'd managed to ruin our weekend. The restaurant bar proudly boasted on its website that it stayed open till midnight. When we turned up, it shut its' doors at 7.30 p.m for Summer Closing. Call me cynical, but surely the summer opening hours should be longer, not shorter than winter hours. Overall, the Swissotel in Damrak was of a very poor standard and it clearly does not derserve its four stars.
