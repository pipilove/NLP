Not a five star hotel

We stayed here for 4 nights mainly due to some rave reviews on tripadvisor and the cheap rate with expedia (approx. æ‹¢32 per person per night in a twin room). However, we believe the hotel only merits 5 stars if you pay extra for a Ku'dam view (30 euros extra per night per room) or go for the executive upgrade (approx 50 euros extra per night per room). Our room was very clean and the bathroom was lovely, but there was not enough wardrobe space, coathangers or pillows for 2 people. Although we expected to have an inside view we did not expect such an awful outlook ie. many hotel room windows facing us and a bleak courtyard down below. You don't receive any of the extras mentioned by other reviewers unless you upgrade which contradicts the overall five star rating given to this hotel. The hotel staff were courteous and friendly, however, and the hotel itself was spotless if a bit minimalistic and clinical as was the room which was very bare apart from just one picture on the wall.Location was okay, near to the shops and U-Bahn stop but the nearby cafes were always crowded and busy. Not an area for people who want lively nightlife though. In general, it was not the bargain it initially seemed but we got what we paid for. Next time, we would rather look for a hotel with more atmosphere.
