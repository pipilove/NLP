Enjoyed the Marriott

We were there last month at the start and end of our honeymoon and really enjoyed staying here. The staff knew it was our honeymoon and bumped us to an Executive Level Suite - it was a nice size, 2 bathrooms and a fabulous view of the Opera House. Also, they sent a complimentary bottle of sparkling wine. It was very clean, service was great - concierge was very helful with directions, making dinner reservations, etc - and it is a great location for tourists. Easy access to Opera House, Botanic Gardens, bridge walk, buses, ferries to beaches. There did not seem to be a ton of nightlife and some other areas looked funkier with more interesting shops, bars, maybe cheaper dining options. But it was great if you only have a few days in town and want to hit the big attractions. The Executive Lounge was nice - not sure its worth it if you pay for it (which we did during our end stay) but there is a nice buffet breakfast, soft beferages all day, and a pretty good cocktail hour (2 hrs food, 4 hours drinks). Overall, we highly recommend it for a business stay or a first-timer to Sydney.
