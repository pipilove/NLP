Good hotel, lousy staff

The hotel is ideally located. If you're a walker, you are close to many attractions. Room was big, bath was lovely, but watch out for the tile floor after you shower. No curtains, and water pours off you onto the tile floor which has a drain. Put your towel on the wet floor or you will definitely slip.Desk staff needs to go to a Waldorf class on manners. Very cold reception, couldn't answer a few simple questions for directions to a few of the sights or an ATM.Room was nice but does need to be vacuumed more frequently than ours was.. Pretzels and cookies under the bed. Chair upholstery needs to be cleaned. We turned the cushions over. What a difference.. Don't eat breakfast in the restaurant, too costly. Walk 2 to 3 blocks away and get a muffin, coffee, or egg sandwich for about 6 Euros..Liked the room, and the location, but didn't care for the staff of the hotel. Look around the same area for another hotel. Think you can do better.
