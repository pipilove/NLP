half a hotel, double a bill

The communal areas are fantastic , well designed and funky. The pool area is great , and the general staff very friendlyThe rooms are awful ... they are large , but are now terribly dated and in need of serious refurbishment .. the bathrooms especially are horribleThe cost of staying here !! the room rate is high, but my 5 day bill was average of 200eur a day in extras (room service breakfast, lunch by the pool -grilled lobster 150eur if you are crazy enough to order it, I wasnt- and a drink or two by the bar)stay somewhere else in barcelona ... and go to the Arts to visit the great bar and the fantastic Arola restaurant
