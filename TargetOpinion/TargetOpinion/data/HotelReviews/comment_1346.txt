noisy

My husband and I was on our honeymoon and at first we were very pleased with our room and the room service and quality of food was excellent but the only thing was that we must have had children staying above us as all we could hear was a thumping noise as if they were running up and down the floor especially a night when we were trying to get to sleep, as a result we wont consider staying there again.
