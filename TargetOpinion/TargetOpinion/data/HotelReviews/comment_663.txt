Not the greatest hotel we have stayed in

Hotel location was good, rooms were clean  the housekeeping staff were lovely. Room smelt of smoke when 'no smoking' requested. Room was small - no bath  the shower room was very small with a tiny corner shower. The Reception staff were aloof  sometimes quite rude. Breakfast was very average  waiting staff very average - on the plus side Berlin was amazing the restaurant across the road from the Mark Hotel - The Meineke Restaurant was lovely both food wise  staff wise  there was a little bar on the same side of the road as the hotel but near to Kurfurstendamm str can't remember the name but the late night atmosphere for couples was romantic and welcoming - see as much as you can Berlin it is a lovely city - we will return - different hotel though!
