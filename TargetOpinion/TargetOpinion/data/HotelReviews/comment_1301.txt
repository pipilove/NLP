Loved the hotel, service sucked!

While the hotel itself was nice, if not bit pricey, the service was not. There was a conference while we were there and a disco had been set up right below our room for the conference attendees. The floor was shaking the music was so loud. As the hotel was oversold we couldn't be moved and the only thing they offered to do for us was pay for a cab to another hotel, no offer of rooms elsewhere or anything. Oh...we did get a free overpriced breakfast out of it. Don't eat in the dining room, way overpriced for what you get...$25 for Bacon and Eggs?Would not stay there again, not for the amount we paid and the service we got.
