An old berlin institution, great pick

I stayed Savoy for two nights. The location is really convenient to use any public transport (400m from Zoo Station)and two blocs away from KUFUDAMM.The front desk was always polite as well as effieicent.The room decor was a classy, and yet cosy. very good after a long walking day in Berlin. My single room has a huge bathroom and a balcony. Some previous reviewers complained about the smoke released from the Cigar bar. It was not too heavy in my room since I aksed for non-smoking one. Breakfest is average, It did have a good selection but a bit pricey 19euros since you can have a decent breakfest in any Kaffee in Berlin. I do recommand Kaffee Einstein.Overall, I will stay Hotel Savoy again for my next Berlin trip for its location and service.
