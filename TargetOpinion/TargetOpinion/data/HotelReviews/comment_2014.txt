would definitely recommend

I recently spent the weekend at the Travelodge. I thought the rooms were perfectly fine. Based on myi nteractions, the staff seemed very pleasant and helpful. I will admit that I didn't try the restaurant, so I cannot advise on the matter. The best thing about this hotel is definitely the location. It is very centrally located and easy to walk to alot of sites including Paddy's Market, Hyde park and the Australia Museum.
