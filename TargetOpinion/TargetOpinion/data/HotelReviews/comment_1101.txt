Well Located Langlois

Very good location for shopping, tourist attractions and transport links, be sure to get a room at the very top of the house as the rest are noisy (we had 4 rooms between our party all over the building). By Paris standards it is value for money, the rooms were a good size with decent bathrooms and were nice and clean. Breakfast is good but you can do as well in the cafe's locally for less money.
