An &quot;ok&quot; stay

I just returned from my second stay at this hotel, this time with my older parents in a second room. While I have read the enthusiastic reviews of the hotel on this website, I have to say they may be creating an impression that may not meet expectations. The rooms are indeed on the large side for Paris and are prettily decorated and somewhat cozy. The bathrooms are very standard, but do have nice towels. The neighborhood near the metro and the Rue Cler is great and the two computers in the lobby are a wonderful convenience. I did not find the staff,except for Frederique, to be very friendly, though they were efficient. The hotel itself is beginning to need renovation, with peeling paint, stained wallpaper and badly stained carpeting in both of our rooms. The noise factor is a problem. The walls are paper thin and the noise from the elevator and staff banging around starts at 6:30am. We are not light sleepers, but it was tough. I will probably investigate other hotels before staying here again.
