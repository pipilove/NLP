It was all a bunch of lies.

Superior does NOT mean a guranteed view! If you're picking this hotel, because you want to see the tower out your window, DON'T! We were so excited about staying at this hotel based on the reviews. We'd seen the candid visitor photos where you can see the eiffel tower from the window of your room. IF you booked a superior room. So, we made sure to book 2 superior rooms, so that my husband and I, as well as grandma and the kids could both have a spectacular view of the tower from our room. We booked months in advance. But apparently, booking early doesn't get you any consideration. Imagine our incredible disappointment when we arrived to find that the room for Grandma and the kids #35 did have a good view of the tower, but the room that they put me and my husband in , #54, did NOT have a view of the tower. When I went downstairs, to ask to be moved to the room that they'd advertised, the clerk slammed things around, and informend me that yes, the room WAS a superior room. I just had to GO OUT ON MY BALCONY, and look way around to the right, and then I could see it. First, if you're at all afraid of heights, there's no way you're going out on that balcony. Second, you can't stay out there, it's far to narrow. The hotel staff was COMLETELY unconcerned that the romantic evening they'd advertised was in fact a lie. In fact, there are only 3 rooms in the hotel with a view of the tower out your window as they advertise, but many more than that with NO view of the tower out your window that they classify as SUPERIOR. So, if you think that you're going to get one of the good ones for certain just because you book a superior room, DON'T COUNT ON IT! You're really paying for a CHANCE that you get a room with a real view of the tower. Also, if you do stay at this hotel, the breakfast room is like an oven. I'd eat somewhere else.
