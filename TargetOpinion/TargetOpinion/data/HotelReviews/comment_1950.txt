Great views

Stayed here for three nights on one of the higher floors. View was amazing of the skytower and beyond. Room was lovely, very clean and modern. Location was fantastic; near to the train station (for handy access from the airport) and in the middle of the main shopping area. There was a large variety of pastries, meats, fruit to choose from for breakfast - with European and Japanese tastes catered for.
