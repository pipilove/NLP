At least a roof above your head...

I found the rating in the other reviews were good, so we contacted the hotel after arriving in Seattle. We were very dissapointed: Noisy (nightclub next to building, busy street), everything looks as if it wasnéº“t replaced or repaired the last 40 years and the bed sheets showed lots of holes caused by cigarettes.... In the morning we adults had an icecold shower, the kids refused to do so.... Well, we paid only $130 but this was the highest price we ever spent on a Youth hostel style-room.We will never book this hotel again!
