Disappointing

A business type hotel close to Sants station, convenient for access to the airport and the metro station for Barcelona's tourist spots. The rooms were spacious, clean and well kept. For breakfast there was a wide choice of food available but the organisation was dreadful and on the Saturday it descended into the farcical with guests queueing for upwards of 30 mins to get into the dining area. One further point, check your credit card bill carefully, I found 40+ euros were charged to my credit card after we had checked out.
