Beware-NOT one of SF's Top Ten Hotels!

We stayed here New Year's Eve and the dismal journey began with the front desk completely disregarding the KING room which I had confirmed (they acknowledged the confirmation) and which I paid more for...but which they had no explanation for. And I'm a member of their so-called loyalty club!They had no back-up plan for this situation and instead gave us two queen rooms. Two separate rooms. Not exactly an ideal situation on New Year's Eve or anytime.Old. Musty. Dusty. This is what comes to mind when I think about it. The furnishings in these rooms (since we saw two) are six months from shabby. NOT chic. The patterns, colors, poor lighting and such just create an un-inviting atmosphere. The marketing photos are not a good representation of the actual rooms. The AC situation is something else altogether.Make sure you ask for a space heater!The lobby is lovely but doesn't make up for what's lies upstairs. A major overhaul is needed here.
