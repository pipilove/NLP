Great location, shabby rooms, renovations involve lots of grinding

This was a Priority Club PointBreaks award stay for me - the hotel is offering award nights for only 5,000 points, probably because of the renovations. During the day there is a lot of grinder/jackhammer noise going on, though evenings and mornings until 8:30 AM are quiet.With my award stay my effective rate is US$50 per night - and I wouldn't pay more to stay here in the future. While its Darling Harbour location is very good and you can easily walk to the DH sights and attractions, the rooms themselves are shabby and not well maintained. Furniture is marred, nicked, scratched and worn. My room had several obvious paint patches, some of which are drywall patches that haven't been re-painted to match. Sheer drapes are yellowed and worn. The bathroom is small and outdated. Hallway carpet is appalling in its appearance and hallways have a musty odor. Cleanliness in the rooms seems good - the property simply isn't spending on maintenance.The king bed was comfortable though on casters, for some reason, making it move a bit when you got in. TV channel selection is about 12 channels. Views are so-so at best and there are no real water views from this hotel.If location is your priority you might consider this property at a very low rate. Otherwise, there are many better choices in Darling Harbour.
