Great Hotel but Service Poor

We have just returned from a 3 day break to Disneyland. If you want to get in the Christmas mood then its a wonderful time to go with your children.The hotel is decorated and very festive so is the park.Yes it was very busy but we expected that but we are in agreeance with other postings that a hotel of this size simply does not seem to be able to cope with the breakfast rush. some mornings we gave up on getting a coffee at all and on the last morning the resturant was full ! at 8.30 am so we were ushered into the Dumbo Suite along with many others to eat there. Also after a busy day in the park we fancied a nice sit down in the 1 and only lounge for a drink but there are literally about 7 to 8 sets of sofas. Hardly enough for the hundreds staying in the hotel.there is so much room in the hotel surely they can make another bar/lounge somewhere.On the plus side location is fantastic and we popped back numerous times to swim rest etc have a snack (brought from home)! We ate at Cafe Mickey twice lots of characters and food very good Anettes Diner average ..the service not very smiley!!We will definately go back next year and hopefully breakfast will be sorted.
