Perfect for single woman

I have stayed in many little three-star hotels around Paris, and found this one to be the best value due to it's location, cleanliness, helpful staff, and tasteful, well-equipped room. The tea kettle and biscuits are a nice touch. The breakfast room is very charming and they provide a very good continental breakfast. The lift wasn't working for half of my stay, but they assured me it was being fixed once and for all. They did carry my suitcase down the stairs when I left without any grumbling. I like the location for easy access to a couple of good cafe's and grocery shops. When I traveling solo, I don't like to be out much after dark, but here you can easily eat a nice dinner a few steps from the hotel or buy food items while you're out during the day for a bed picnic. Rue Cler nearby is a walking street full of shops and restaurants.
