Beware of this hotel's cancellation policy !

My wife and I were due to stay at this hotel for three days in September, at the end of a tour of Brittany. Whilst in Brittany, my wife got the news that her mum was about to pass away, and we had to cancel our Paris visit and return to England urgently. We phoned the Albe FOUR CLEAR DAYS before our scheduled arrival, to regretfully cancel the booking, and we told them of the circumstances.The employee who took the call said that as we didn't have access to e-mail in Brittany, the cancellation was noted, and a refund of our deposit would be no problem.Following the death and funeral of our mother, we asked the Albe by what means they would refund our â‚¬180 deposit. They were totally adamant that there would be no refund, and I can't now persuade them otherwise. Needless to say, we won't be going there at any time in the future. There are plenty of efficient and friendly hotels in the wonderful Latin quarter, but this doesn't appear to be one of them.
