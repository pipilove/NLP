Great Hotel

This was a wonderful Hotel. After reading some of the bad reviews, we started to worry about staying here. Our worries washed away the moment we reached the hotel. The staff was amazing, and went out of their way to help us. The coffee and treats in the moring was amazing. The wine and treats at night were great also, nice touch. We took the advice from other reviewers and requested a court-yard side room. Glad we did, it was very quite. Some say the rooms are small, but ours wasn't that tiny. A normal size hotel room compared to other hotel rooms we have stayed in, besides we didn't spend much time in the room when there is so much to do around San Francisco.I will stay here again if I ever get the chance to go back to San Francisco.
