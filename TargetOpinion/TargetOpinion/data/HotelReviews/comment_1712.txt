Okay for the weekend

Arrived after the Mariners baseball game on Friday evening. Check in was okay. Room was smaller than we had anticipated, as we had gotten a suite and it was tight with two adults and two older teenage boys! Parking spaces were SO NARROW that we had difficulty getting in and out of our van. There was not alot of room for error when you were backing up either.Continental breakfast was plentiful with waffles, juice/coffee, yogurt, hard boiled eggs, cheese, bagels/toast, danish, cereal, apples and oranges. It was nice to open up the living area doors to look at Lake Union, but there was no balcony to speak of (BE CAREFUL, those railings are wobbly!)Okay for a weekend stay but we will not stay here again as we find the Silver Cloud Broadway is better for us.
