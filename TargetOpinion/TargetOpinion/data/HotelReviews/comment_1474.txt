Nice staff, tiny room

The Westin is huge with different elevator banks and hallways - and the staff is wonderful and very friendly. The building is beautiful both outside and inside - there's a cafe and some shops available too. Location is central and on a pretty busy street with all the shops of Union Square right outside. The trolley is right across the street.My only complaint is the room. It was TINY. I live in NYC so I'm used to small rooms, but this is one small room! The coffee maker was in the closet. The entrance door opens right into the bed. You can't have the bathroom door open and the closet door open at the same time. The walls and doors were super thin. I heard everything next door - the TV, conversation, yawning - I heard everything in the hall too. The view was a brick wall. I think it was just my luck with the room assignment and thank goodness I traveled alone on this trip because this room was really meant for one person. I'd go back but I'd definitely make sure that I had a different room.
