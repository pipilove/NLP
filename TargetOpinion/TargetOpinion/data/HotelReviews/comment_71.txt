Skip the Krasnapolsky

The Krasnapolsky was touted as a 5-star hotel but it is anything but. Many of the rooms in the main hotel are small and outdated. We stayed in the newer rooms, but you have to leave the hotel and go through an alley to enter the building with the newer rooms. Some unsavory people hang out in this alley. It was overpriced for the experience. The concierge was extremely rude to us and the hotel lobby is always crowded and full of smoke (from all kinds of things). If you have the resources, I suggest the Intercontinental Amstel. It is a bit off the beaten path but it is a haven with the most pleasant staff.
