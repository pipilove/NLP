Nice Hotel

This was is a nice hotel situated in a very central location in Sydney. As a female travelling alone I felt safe walking to and from this hotel during the day and in the evening. The room is faily nicely decorated and it also has a microwave.I also stayed at the Y on Hyde Park during the latter half of my trip. I liked the Travelodge much better since the rooms were cleanier, nicer looking and it has a much nicer lobby.I would stay there again.
