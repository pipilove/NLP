Ku'Damm 101 Review A neutral review this one.

It's not that central, or close to an underground train line. It's reasonably stylish and modern, though is starting to show signs of wear overall - certainly no longer cutting edge.However the room rates aren't too bad, public transport in Berlin is excellent and crucially, it's stumbling distance from one of the worlds best cocktail bars, the Universum Lounge.One for couples and groups overall I think. I've stayed 4 or 5 times and never had any problem with staff or any other issues.
