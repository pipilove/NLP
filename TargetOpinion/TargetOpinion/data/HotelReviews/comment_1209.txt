Not great...

We booked an executive room as it wasn't too much more to get the little bit of extra space. Well, I'd have hated to see what the smaller rooms looked like as ours wasn't huge - we weren't falling over things but it wasn't what I would call spacious. We checked in and whilst the room itself was quite nice, the bathroom was really very basic and a little bit grotty - the sink was cracked, the bath looked very old....so I went to reception and told them I didn't really expect to find a cracked sink and did they have another room. We were shown another room, and although the sink was newer, it was all just a little too basic - the sort of thing I might expect to find in a youth hostel but not in a hotel charging decent prices. I told the hotel I wasn't happy and they tried to find us alternative accommodation in a sister hotel but the rooms in those hotels were tiny, so we checked out and went to stay at the JW Marriott round the corner, which was streaks nicer, for about $20 more a night. I had had high hopes for the Rex based on the website and the reviews but to be honest, in the flesh, it just wasn't that great and not quite the sort of 'boutique' hotel I had been led to expect. Although my experience of the rooms wasn't great, the staff were very helpful and didn't charge us for the first night which was very decent of them.
