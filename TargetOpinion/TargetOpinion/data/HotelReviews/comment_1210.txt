Great hotel

I thought the Hotel Rex was charming. My room was large with two double beds. I enjoyed the book-themed ambience. Even though I arrived too late for the complimentary wine hour, the front desk told me I could go the first floor lounge/bar if I still wanted it. The central location and free wireless internet access were also pluses. I'd definitely stay there again.
