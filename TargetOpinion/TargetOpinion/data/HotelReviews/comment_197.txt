I am still staying in the Banks Mansion as I write this using the free Internet access and having a drink from the Free Bar too! These are just two of the things that make staying here a great experience.The Banks is an old converted merchants house by the Herengracht. The hotel is all done in an Art Deco style which only adds to the experience.My friends are staying here too and we all agree that we really like this hotel.Some of the rooms have a bath and some like mine have a shower. I am more of a shower person so this suits me but you can always specify which you prefer when you book. I was also allocated a non-smoking room which is great.One great thing about my shower is that it has a steamer built in with a eucalyptus oil option. I was out last night and found the smoke bothered me a bit so I was bunged up in my nose today. I just put on the steam room amd then sat in it for ten minutes and found this to be a great help.The buffet breakfast is very extensive too with both hot and cold items available.The staff are all very courteous and helpful.Overall I would have to say this hotel wins out because of the location, staff and overall standard of service offered. The rooms are all a decent size too which is a plus in Amsterdam as old buildings tend to have small rooms
