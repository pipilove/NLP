5 Stars for deco but 2 Stars for Service

We booked a non-smoking room and found that we had been allocated a smoking room of very inferior quality but managed to change to a vastly superior room the next day by the skin of our teeth.That evening we reserved a table for the Fish Buffet for 8pm. Arrived at 8 promptly. We eventually managed to be shown to our table and ordered wine but only afterwards to discover all the food had gone - nothing left except the dregs! The waiter seemed not too bothered. I questioned him why he had taken our wine order surely knowing full well there was no food left. He seemed less than apologetic and asked for payment for the wine! I complained at reception and we were offered free cocktails. On the day of our return, with time on our hands, we decided to take the train to the airport and were advised by the bell captain to go via Bundes Platz to Schoenefeld. Taking his advice was a big mistake - there are no trains to Schoenefeld via Bundes Platz on a Sunday.This hotel is badly in need of a manager who knows what is going on in the place.
