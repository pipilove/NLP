Overrated!!!!!!!

If you enjoy being herded from hotel room to hotel room, be sure to stay at the Argonaut Hotel. Are also great at denying the guests accomodations one purchased and are great at projecting the blame onto the guest and the the travel agencies they are affiliated with. In the end, the room assignment was sub par for comfort, customer service paltry and effort to provide the services they so proudly advertise was non-existent. Would never return to the Argonaut Hotel.In the end though, the Argonaut Hotel is so self righteousness that a poor review will be viewed as another nemesis and nothing more.
