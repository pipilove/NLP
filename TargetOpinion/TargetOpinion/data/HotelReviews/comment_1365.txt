Great Location

We stayed at the Tuscan Inn for 3 nights in April. It is in a great location, the rooms are clean and comfortable and the managers wine hour is a welcome bonus.There was a problem though that the hotel did not receive our request for a twin room and we ended up in a double for the first night. Despite 3 requests and 3 promises for a rollaway bed, it never arrived. The night front desk personnel were disinterested and could not be bothered, although the day personnel were lovely and sorted another room for us.If you plan to be out and about most of the time you are in SF, I'd definately recommend the hotel. But if you want to relax in the hotel, then you'd be better choosing somewhere else.By the way, the hotel's restaurant is great. The food is lovely and the staff very friendly.
