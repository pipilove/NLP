Unique, Modern and Personal

Once you stay at Hotel Max you will be bored with all the rest. The artwork, the music, the rich colors of the walls, carpeting, trim, and furnishings will awaken the artiste in you and embrace your soul. We began to feel relaxed within moments of checking into our room. It is like no other hotel, motel, resort, cabin, bed-n-breakfast, or condo we have ever stayed in. The soft, cozy beds, pillows, and comforters are the ultimate in comfort. (No scratchy, stiff, polyester bedspreads in this hotel. Thank goodness!) I slept better than I have in months!The hotel staff are professional, friendly, and very attentive. They rarely missed an opportunity to carry bags, open a door, or key the elevator for us.Small rooms? Small bathrooms? Small elevators? All true; that said, those issues quickly became irrelevant to us during our stay. The comfort, hospitality, cleanliness, and excellent central location to Seattle's best venues undeniably surpassed the importance of &quot;size&quot; for us. Hotel Max has a truly warm and unique atmosphere that you will not easily find any where else. The Red Fin Restaurant is a must, especially if you like sushi. But, rest assured there are plenty of equally delightful options besides sushi. We tried several small plate dinners and selected sushi from the daily fresh sheet including a special request sushi roll. Every item was prepared perfectly. The plate presentations were works of art. Each bite was more delicious than the last. Our taste buds were in paradise. The service is marvelous and the atmosphere is lovely. I can hardly wait to go back! Red Fin is open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner plus they have a late happy hour that starts at 10pm and they provide room service to the hotel at pretty much any hour of the day or night. I believe the selections are more limited in the wee hours of the night but nevertheless if you're hungry you have options.
