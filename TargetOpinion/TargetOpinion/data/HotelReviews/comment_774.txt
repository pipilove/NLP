A disaster waiting to happen...

After check-in we were shown to our room which turned out to be a garden studio when we had booked ( paid for in advance) a management suite. Nobody told us at any point that we were not being allocated our correct room  it was only when we were shown to our room  queried the type of room given that we were told that the hotel was being refurbished  that this was the only room available. After much discussion and disappointment we were finally assured that we would be upgraded the following night  given a complimentary bottle of champagne. There were no other rooms available on our day of arrival. Totally dissatisfied with the deception  lack of customer focus on arrival we felt we had no option but to accept this offer. First morning in our new suite we were woken at 7.00 a.m. to the sound of drills and constant hammering. Following our call to reception we were told that the hotel was undergoing 'emergency essential maintenance'  there was nothing they could do. Basically, we had to put up with the noise and disturbance. However, the same occurred on day 2 and day 3 - at precisely the same time! In the meantime, on day 2 we discovered a bag of dirty working clothes behind the curtains in our room - obviously overlooked by housekeeping  not a very good indication of their levels of cleanliness! The bathroom only had one bathrobe, one pair of slippers, insufficient shampoo  shower gel  was generally shabby. Overall, we were extrememly disappointed with our stay in The Mandala. We paid for and expected 5-star service  accommodation but actually experienced far less. The staff were cold  uncaring and really did little to ease the problems we encountered.Stay there at your peril!! For us - never again.......
