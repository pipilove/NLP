Wouldn't recommend it!

I stayed in this hotel at the end of January. On the plus side, the location is excellent and the staff are helpful. The downside is that the room we had was extremely small, dark and dingy - I asked if we could change rooms but the hotel was fully booked. I have also unfortunately managed to catch scabies which is highly unpleasant. I have stayed in many hotels and can say that this is the worst one ever - I would definitely not stay at this hotel again.
