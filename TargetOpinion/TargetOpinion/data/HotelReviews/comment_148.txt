Be aware of the large and noisy construction!

There is a reason for the special rates that you may find: there is major on-going construction just next to the hotel. The pictures that you may see with the nice view of the canals are outdated, now this is a big construction area. I stayed in this hotel two nights at the end of the august. In general the hotel is located in a very congested and noisy area. But while I was given a quiet room (with a view of a wall) next morning I woke-up at 8 am due to the drilling noise of the outside construction. The noise was so laud that at first I was convinced that it was coming from an adjoined room. But the administration said that it was the construction outside and that there was nothing they can do about it. Also when asking for a wake-up call, be aware that it won't be a call but you TV will be automatically turned on-meaning that if you happen to fall asleep with the TV on there will be nothing to wake you up. Don't even waste your time arguing with the administration.
