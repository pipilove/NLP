Good - but not that good!

A good hotel, but slightly less than I would expect from a five star - in my opinion it's a good 4 star.Although the rooms are supposed to be cleaned twice a day, ours was done only once on one of the days - no great problem, but not the standard advertised.The bed had to be the most uncomfortable we'd ever slept in - rock hard.If you want to drink bottled water, take in your own. The mini bar charges 4 Euros for a third of a litre - sheer extortion!Staff very helpful - good breakfast - although sometimes the waiters disappeared, and forgot what was a simple request for tea instead of coffee. The hotel is also situated at the port, which might have explained a chill wind in early May. Handy though for the excellent red and blue route tourist buses - must be the best value in the city.Overall an OK short stay, but we have stopped in better hotels.
