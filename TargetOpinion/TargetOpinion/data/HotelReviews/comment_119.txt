A brilliant location

It was 18 years since our last stay at The Park and we were definitely not disappointed with our recent vist. The hotel has just been renovated to the highest standard. The rooms are spacious and the bed has to be the most comfortable we have ever slept in abroad. The standard of cleanliness was excellent too.The fixtures and fittings are very good. From the moment we arrived the staff were so very helpful. There was a problem with the electricity in our room but within 10 minutes of reporting it the electrician had rectified the problem. Added to all this the location is brilliant. We look forward to a return visit.
