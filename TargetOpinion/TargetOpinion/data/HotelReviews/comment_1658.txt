Not up to the W standards

I travel regularly for business and stay at the W in LA whenever possible. I was excited to stay at this property for this first time when business brought me to Seattle. I took a cab, and upon arrival had to carry my baggage up a flight of stairs to check in. There was no doorman at the door where I entered and no one offered me help although I checked in at a slow time of day. My room, while certainly not the same sort of room I had in LA, was clean and the in window seat a nice touch. The beds, true to W style, were fabulous and I always appreciate the bliss spa products. And that's about the end of the positives. They were a lot of overlooked details, and those details are what seperates a great hotel from the mediocre. I booked straight through the hotel website for a 2 night stay. I saw that the rate went down later in the week, so I was surprised when I was given a room right off of the elevator. I heard people talking outside the elevator in my room. The look on my door was sticky and I had to slam the door very hard to shut it. If I didn't shut it hard behind me, it would have been propped open. The first morning I did not receive a paper and the internet was spotty throughout the whole visit; I eventually just gave up and used my blackberry. The gym, while pretty well equipped for a downtown hotel, has in need of maintenance with only half of the cardio machines in full working order and the water cooler was empty. I gave the front desk this feedback as I was checking out in the morning and while I was listened to, was not compensated or offered a discount on my bill. Not a 4 star hotel, and certainly not a place I would stay again. It was service more along the lines of a 2 star average chain hotel, not what I have come to expect from the W.
