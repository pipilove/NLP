Iffy....

Well, I am not sure if I really liked or did not like this hotel. There were good things and bad things..GoodLocation is great! We were close to so many great things and the trolley stop in right out front. Staff- they were nice. Bathrooms were very clean!Bad-Paper thin walls. I heard everything my neighbor said. It was awful.Bed- hard as rock. I actually woke up with a backache.Overall impression of the hotel could be better. The rooms are very very tiny and they def need to redo the hotel. The decorations, carpet and bedspreads are old and shabby. Carpet looks dirty. If you are sharing a room with someone you do not know, get TWO rooms. I felt like I was back in college in my dorm room...Ask for a room in the back of the hotel or high up. You can hear everything on the street... If you are looking for a hotel that is inexpensive, close to the sights and just want to drop your stuff off and go- this is the place. Just bring earpplugs and expect to feel very close to the person you are sharing a room with.
