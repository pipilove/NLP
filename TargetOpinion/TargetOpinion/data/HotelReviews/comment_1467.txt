You can do a lot better in San Francisco

If you want to impress your cab driver - go with the St. Francis. If you need to be directly across the street from Union Square and can't walk even one block (and why you would go to SF if that were the case) - go with the St. Francis. If you want to pay more than other hotels - go with the St. Francis.Ths St. Francis is old, large and used to be quite grand. It is now a bit tired. However, the staff don't know that. The concierge is excellent - truly first class. The bell staff are fair. The hotel frequently endures labor protests. When that happens the bell staff are posted as a security barrier and become somewhat useless for the usual purposes. The front desk staff are not too helpful.I've stayed there before (hey I think picketers shouting Hotel clients should be aware - St. Francis is unfair is fun to watch). Here is the problem. You are right on the trolley line but several blocks from the BART station. You can book whatever room you want and confirm it all you like but you will get what they have. For example, book a king room. Go ahead and confirm that you have a king room. Then arrive and find you are in a double bed not a king. Explain to the front desk that you reserved a king. They will agree that you did. They will confirm that you are in a double. They will then tell you that rooms are subject to availability. They will take your name and number (and usually your cell number) and they will promise to look into it and see what they can do. Don't hold your breath. In a survey of 7 or 8 folks who had the same issue none received any follow-up. That's the problem with the St. Francis.. They don't care because they don't have to care. That hotel will be full no matter what they do. Do yourself a favor - there are at least 10 hotels within 2 blocks of Union Square. Save money, aggravation etc etc and stay somewhere that is hungry for your business. SF is a great city - why bother with arrogance.
