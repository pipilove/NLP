Great handy hotel

Booked this hotel after reading the Trip Advisor reviews, and glad I did.Perfect location - few blocks up from main shopping area, three blocks from Chinatown, on main cable car route to Fishermans Wharf.Pleasant, large room with a huge comfy bed. The hotel website doesn't mention air con, but it does have climate control so had no issues (and I'm fussy about this!).Handy breakfast buffet to get you started - coffee, bagels, pastries, juices and fresh fruit. Door staff handy for getting taxis and booking shuttle back to the airport.LOVED San Francisco, can't wait to go back and will stay here again.
