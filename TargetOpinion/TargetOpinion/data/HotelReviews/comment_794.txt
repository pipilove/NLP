good place to stay only if price is right

Stayed for 8 nights in july . If you can stay at this hotel for no more than 120eu w/breakfast it is a good buy.21 eu each for breakfast is very expensive. Anything more is not worth the price. Found a dirty sock on check in. Had to beg the waiter in the morning for a second cup of coffee. Coffee machine in room did not work till someone came up to fix it. Two nights out of 8 had no turndown service. And a couple of nights the service came after we had gone to bed. This is not a 5* hotel. Was very disappointed after reading all the rave reviews about this hotel. Will try another hotel next time.
