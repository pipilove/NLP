Perfect - really should be a 5* rather than a 4*

Myself and my partner have just returned from Hotel 1898 for a 3 night stay from the 9th to the 12th of February. I've never actually written a review before however Tripadvisor was very helpful to me when choosing the hotel for a very special surprise weekend with my partner so I've decided to put our views in writing - so here goes!From the outset there was somebody to help with the bags and the staff were very professional, polite and helpful taking us up to the room and even showing us how to use the lights (a very cool and modern dimmer system) and the bathrooms (all Ghroe fittings with a fantastic rainfall shower). The decor was perfect, rooms had plenty of room and nice and quiet (no noise from the hallway hardwood floors as suggested by some - all carpeted). Our room had a brand new 32 LCD TV mounted on the was which was very nice and the aircon was spot on. Breakfast was amazing (I echo what another reviewer said though - get it included in the price or its æ‹¢18 euro a day each). The pool and sauna faclilities were very nice and very quiet also. We spent a fair bit of time at the hotel bar after an evening out chating to Carlos the happy little barman (he makes great and very potent - Sangria which we recomend!) Location - halfway down La Ramblas (directly opposite the Meridian) was perfect.Somebody made a comment about doubting people who wrote these reviews had ever stayed in a 5* hotel. Well I've stayed at the Conrad in Chelsea Harbour, Capodimonte in Sorrento and the Four Seasons in Montreal and I would honestly say that this hotel is up there with them. When we return to Barcelona we will certainly stay at this establishment again.
