Decent choice - but a few bugs in the service

I had expected more from this hotel. It is well situated and has an impressive lobby, but the room was a little small with a tiny bathroom. When I returned my main course in the restaurant because it was unacceptable (lobster the size of a prawn), they still expected me to pay for it. Had to talk to the manager to sort that out. Also upon check-out, they got the costs of my stay wrong, trying to charge me â‚¬200 more then Radisson reservations had booked the room at. Luckily I had a printout of my confirmation. The lobby staff where not all that helpful, they couldn't tell me how to turn out an annoying light in my room, or the cost of the movie service. All in all not the usual Radisson service. Have to note though that the doorman was VERY HELPFUL.
