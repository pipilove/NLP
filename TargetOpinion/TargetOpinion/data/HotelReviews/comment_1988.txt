Home away from Home- Love this place and the staff!

When in Sydney doing business, or taking my family for a well deserved break, we are always treated especially nice.I have stayed here on many occasion over the years and have always felt like so welcome, my only gripe is they have closed the walkway through to David Jones...not happy...now I have to cart all my shopping back by myself!To all the staff keep up the good work  love the breakie buffet.
