Hotel with no soap

My husband and I recently stayed at this hotel for five nights. They are a business hotel with wi-fi on floors 1, 2 and 3. If you're in your room, you pay. We ferried one small sliver of soap from the sink to the tub for a week. An interesting issue considering the price of this room. And the concierge. Hmmm. Well, if you wanted help, forget it. Not available and not interested. Go see the guys at the bar. They were really helpful about what's happening in Seattle! I won't stay here again. Its old, and not very clean.
