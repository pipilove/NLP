My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights after a wedding in Las Vegas.First problem was unloading the car outside, there was nowhere to park.Next problem was when booking in, we were informed there was a mistake in the price that we paid directly to the Hotel some 4 months in advance, we were told that it was an extra $160 to pay.Why in the previous 4 months they could not have informed us is anyones guess, so paying the extra was a big let down.Finally when we stopped off in the bar on our last night for a drink we were told the bar was closed, it was 10.45pm.We went out to another bar and lo and behold on getting back at 12 midnight the bar was open.All in all a nice hotel but our experience was soured
