review of the Pulitzer is probably biased by the fact that I spent the 3 nights before my stay there at the Hotel Colon, which has in my opinion the best location in central Barcelona. Yes, the Pulitzer is a triumph of design, but the location, on one of the dull streets off Catalunya is seedy at best, and the hotel lets itself down in a number of aspects. First point to note is that if you have vertigo, or just a pretty severe fear of heights, then this is NOT the hotel for you. The glass lifts had me quaking in my boots, and the waist high glass railings which look out over the ground floor bar on each floor were enough to make me feel ill. I also wondered at the sense of the waist high railings - very little to prevent the intoxicated leaping over. The rooftop terrace is nice, again once you don't have a fear of heights, however the bar never seemed to be open although the hotel literature said that it opened from 8pm. The rooms are fashionable and comfortable, although the overall black and white aesthetic gives a rather clinical lasting impression. The bathroom was also a good size, with plenty of toiletries, but the sink and shower really lets the hotel down. The sink, of a freestanding marble square style WOULD NOT DRAIN! If for example, you washed your teeth, the sink would fill up and then take twenty minutes to drain. This problem must have existed before our stay, so I'm very surprised that the hotel placed anyone in the room. The showerhead also could not be removed, which reminded me of public swimming baths. But, for those for whom alcohol is key, the bar on the ground floor is lovely (though smoking), and the strawberry daiquiris will take some beating.
