Nice cosy little hotel in busy Paris

Usually I always go to the same hotel in Paris, but decided after reading the review from fellow TAs to try this one out.It's actually a nice and cosy hotel, in a cool neighborhood (Invalides). It's very clean, the rooms are very nice but small (OK. who spends time in his room when in Paris ?) For a 3 star hotel, the price/quality ration is very good (hidden gem ? Maybe).Why not a rating of 5 then ? Mainly because the breakfast isn't that special (this is a standard breakfast in Paris, you can also get it in any bistro or caf√©), and also because I hate being waken up early by workers on the floor above...
