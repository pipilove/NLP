Loved the Orchard

After booking another hotel in the city, I found the Orchard on thiswebsite and immediately cancelled the other reservation and booked this one---THANK GOODNESS!!! It was everything wehoped for. It's a beautiful new hotel--very clean and comfortable,and in a great location. Our room was on the 8th floor, facing the street but it was very quiet. The continental breakfast was goodand more than adequate to start your day and all of the staff werevery friendly and helpful. A great bargain for this city.
