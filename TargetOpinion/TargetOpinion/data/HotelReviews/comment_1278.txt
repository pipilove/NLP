Previous reviews by owners/managers?!

Not the reality that I experienced! I was there last weekend, my fourth visit in a years time. Three previous stays were for business trips. Yes, the Castle Inn is centrally located and has off-street parking. But, the clientele being catered to has DRASTICALLY changed! The new, evidently preferred customer is the party all night and urinate off the balcony crowd. Literally. The owners/managers were certainly mum on any behavior or guest management efforts, even bragging that these same guests were back out drinking on the sidewalks at 8am the next morning. Just what a business customer or traveling couple wants to hear? Definitely not. Drug store earplugs and a fan running on high did not drown the night-long parties. Definitely not the experience I expected or paid for! If money is your only concern and you don't mind lodging with hooligans for neighbors, this is your place.
