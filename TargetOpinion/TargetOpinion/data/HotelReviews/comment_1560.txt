Seattle: Sheraton Downtown -enjoyable stay

Got a deal on hotwire for two days:Great location, very good service, ok room.We had an appointment to which we were late, so it was wonderful for just drive up, have valet take car, bel-hop grab bags and be in room, with bags, in less than five minutes. Room is ok -not great, bed was good.Location is close to all shopping, Pike Place etc. We parked the car and walked/took bus/cab all around Seattle.Also enjoyed fitness room and pool on top floor- Step-master while enjoying view of downtown with bay in distance...
