Great Location, great rooms

Booked most of our hotels for Australia and New Zealand trip based on other trip advisor postings. Spent 4 nights in this Hotel. We made sure to ask that our room was higher up or on the other side of the hotel to avoid the noise of the monorail which runs right in front of the hotel's (about) 4th floor. Stayed on the 8th floor and had no noise problems. Room was updated, rather large, and very clean. Had a fridge in it as well. Location of this hotel is close to the train, touristy bus servive, light rail and monorail. Very easy to get around.Internet was $5 for 30 minutes, never had to wait to get in and log on. It was quick and fast, unlike some other places we stayed which took forever to upload pictures. Staff was nice enough. Concierge was kind enough to look up a few things on internet about Sydney, and make tour recommendations and food recomendations. Take note - this hotel appears to be right on the edge of Chinatown. We knew it was close, but was closer than expected. For a few nights we wandered up and down the bustling Chinatown streets and had amazing food. We just weren't prepared for that to be the main option in very close proximity. Would definately stay here again.
