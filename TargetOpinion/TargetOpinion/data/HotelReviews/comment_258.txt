not worth 4*s

great location. lovely lobby. nice staff. then to the room. It was just a standard room but in a 4* hotel it should have been better. The decor was stark. The carpet was very stained with goodness know what. the pillows were like bricks. I had to remake the bed the bedding was all crumpled. At least you had some english tv channels. Breakfast was not included, but at the price even a continental would have been nice. There is a very nice take away sandwich shop near by. I was dissapointed.
