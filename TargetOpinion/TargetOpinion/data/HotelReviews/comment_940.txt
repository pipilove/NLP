So-so

Pros: Great location, very clean facilities, friendly and helpful staff, way above average breakfast buffet, air-conditioned roomsCons: Tiny-tiny rooms, those facing the street are unbearably noisy at night; thermostat in one of the rooms did not workBottom line: for 150 euro per night per double-room one can do better than this
