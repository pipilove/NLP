Spot on

This is our favourite part of Paris but our first visit to this hotel. The reviews are spot on, it's a lovely, clean hotel very convenient for the metro and the famed latin quarter. The weather was lousy but c'est la vie. Our room on the fifth floor was a good size with a queen size bed. We were much amused by the shower which was hand held and attached on a very short line to the bath tub thus requiring one to climb into the bath and kneel down to use it. If you don't see the funny side of this, make sure you book a room with a stand up shower. We thought the breakfast was excellent but dismayed the staff by pressing both the expresso and cafe au lait buttons on the coffee machine, they thought we were mad. Do walk up the hill to the Place Contrescarpe for a drink and some wonderful people watching. Thank you, Hotel Acte V, a lovely stay.
