This hotel may be unsafe for women travelling alone!

On July 6, 2005 I arrived from dinner at 12:30 am to my hotel, Hotel Relais Bosquet. I had been at this hotel for 9 days visiting my daughter in Paris. This is the 4th visit to this wonderful neighborhood hotel that is very pretty with a very lovely staff. That evening the night desk clerk became very agressive upon my arrival. He pulled me into the basement kitchen to get wine from the refrigerator. I managed to get back up the stairs. He then tried to come to my room. I quickly went up the stairs to the room of a friend and her son to learn that his behavior toward her had been much the same. The next morning I, along with my female friend and her son who were also guests in the hotel, filed a formal written complaint against the actions of the night desk clerk with the hotel manager. We learned that he had worked there for 4 years. The hotel sent both of us roses and champagne as an apology. On the early evening of July 7, the manager asked all of us to confront this man with our written complaints in both English and French. He began to scream at me and call me a liar. I left the area and called American Express to assist me to find another hotel immediately. The hotel did not fired this man. I had reservations to return to the hotel July 14 for 3 nights. The hotel suggested I go elsewhere because he would be remaining in employment there. The hotel did not charge me for my last 2 nights at the hotel. The hotel did not charge the other woman and her son for 2 nights, also. We both checked out on July 8 and did not return the next week as planned.I consider this an unsafe hotel for women who may be travelling with another female friend, son or daughter, or alone. It makes me very sad because I have loved the hotel and the location. I moved to the Intercontinental Hotel for the return to Paris.
