Horrific Apartment/Tenement squalor

Don't be duped into renting one of these luxury apartments. I rented a two bedroom deluxe for a week and it was filthy and disgusting. I checked out the following morning. Words can not describe this experience other than to say that I felt like I was in a ghetto. The hallway entrance should have been my first clue as the carpet is torn and filthy, the walls are filthy and it just gets worse from there. I will say that the night manager that I spoke to was very professional and polite vs the girls at the front desk who giggled and laughed when I lodged my complaint. I am very puzzled by some of the other reviews regarding these apartments and their glowing comments. I cannot believe that the hotel is even associated with these luxury apartments; it is false advertising to describe these as luxury apartments. I will never stay at the Krasnapolsky again!!!And yes indeed you do wander aimlessly through the kitchen to get to your luxury apartment. I recommend you keep wandering right past them to the Pulitzer or the Dylan. Luckily, I was able to get a room at the Dylan so my trip wasn't completely ruined.
