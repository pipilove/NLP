As advertised

I decided to stay at this hotel as it was my first stop after 30 hours of travelling from Australia, and I wanted a comfortable room. I stayed on the fifth floor, facing the main street and I barely heard any noise at all - not even any subway noise as mentioned in other reviews. As I was pretty much shattered after my flights, and suffering from a cold, I spent a great deal more time in the room than I had intended. I found the room to be very comfortable and the in room wifi was very handy. Overall a great stay.
