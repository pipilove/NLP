Oh so sorry to say its not perfect!

Just returned from our second stay at Four Seasons George V, Paris. We were lucky to be upgraded again to a beautiful suite. All was perfect until the last evening. Started with room attendant smashing a glass by the mini-bar, accidents do happen. Took 1/2 hour for housekeeping to arrive to clear up glass, not unduly a problem for us. Ordered room service, two meat dishes of the day, as per previous evening. Had checked the content of the dishes earlier in the day and confirmed with room service when ordered. As usual the meal arrived exactly on time but this time completely the wrong order! Room attendant phoned room service to get order changed to our original request. Room service called to apologise and double check order. Order arrived 40 mins later, 1hr 10 mins now since first ordering meal, correct meat everything else wrong! Asked for bread to be brought as well and when this was delivered the attendant dropped it on the floor. He spent some time on hands and knees looking for a missing bread roll, which by this time had become quite comical! All this shattered our illusions about the service from this beautiful hotel. Try the ice-bar if you are visiting, we had a wonderful time there. Do check your bill as mentioned in other posts,we were charged for parking two cars for one of our nights stay! The wrong room rate had also been quoted. Would we go back? yes definitely!!
