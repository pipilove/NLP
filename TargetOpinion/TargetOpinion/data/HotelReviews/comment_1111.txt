Careful - call them directly

Stayed here for 4 days during our last trip to Paris in Sept because of the great reviews. I reserved through one of the internet websites and about a week later I called to confirm and there was no booking in my name. The website confirmed they had a reservation but the hotel never did receive a confirmation from the website. This is not the first time this has happened to me.The staff were very helpful and after 4 or 5 calls, they gave us a large room with 3 single beds but we had to pay 24Euros extra and there was no AC. It was noisy outside our window which we had to leave open as it was very warm. The location is perfect (about a block from the louvre) and you can walk to almost everything or take the river Siene ferrys across the main blvd. Don't forget, it is Paris and you will not receive the same amenities as you would in a similar hotel in North America. Overall, it was clean and comfortable (except the AC and noise) and there were no other problems. However, when I go back, I will probably shop around and try to find a small hotel off the beaten path as there are many in this area.
