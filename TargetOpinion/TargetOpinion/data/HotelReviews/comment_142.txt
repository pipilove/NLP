Very nice place

We have just returned from a 4 night anniversary trip to the Victoria hotel Amsterdam. There is no scaffolding or any other evidence of re-decorating. We were greeted by the very friendly staff and found our way through the swish hotel to our room. Everywhere was clean and sparkling and very modern looking. The room was nice and spacious (268) , chairs and tables, desk, wardrobe and well stocked mini bar. The bed was very comfortable and even had duvets with lovely soft covers rather than blankets and sheets! Easily pleased!! The window looked out onto a small back street which did become a little noisy when people started to roll home around 2-3a.m or in the morning when the road sweepers came but it was fine with the window shut, and I did notice that we had air con although we didn't use it. The bathroom was fine, clean and well equipped and the shower nearly knocked us out it was so powerful !  We ate in the restaurant on one night when we were to tired to walk any further. The surroundings were lovely, with some great modern art on the walls and the staff were very polite and attentive. We had a 3 course meal each which was great and very reasonable at around 70 euros with drinks. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel which was expensive at 20 euros, instead we just tried a different cafe each morning around the local area. The cafes towards Haarlem st were better than the ones on Damrak.  Having read the previous reviews of this hotel I would say that now all the decorations have been completed this hotel is up to its 4 star status.It was clean and modern with very helpful,proffessional staff. The location is great too, near the station and other landmarks and if you get lost around Amsterdam at least you only have to follow the signs back to Central station!!  Used hotel.nl to book this hotel with a great discount rate.
