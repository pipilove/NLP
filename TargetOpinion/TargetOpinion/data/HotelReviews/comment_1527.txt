Noise of airconditioner-a standard?

We arranged our stay through a travel agency and unfortunately Warwick Seattle Hotel was the only dissapointment through our trip. During our 3 night stay in Warwick, we changed 3 rooms. Starting from the first minute of our stay, hotel personnel didn`t make us feel like a guest but more like an intruder. They were very reluctant to help and solve complaints. The hotel is right at downtown and 5 minutes to really good restaurants but this seems like the only good thing about it. Although there was availability, the first room they offered was at 2nd floor and our window was directly opening to the car parking at the same level. So we changed the room. In all 3 rooms, there was a loud sound coming from the air conditioner/ heating system which we found unbelievable for an hotel. The hotel personnel told that it is a standard noise for all rooms. So, we tried to avoid using it during the night in order to sleep and if possible only while we were watching TV loudly.
