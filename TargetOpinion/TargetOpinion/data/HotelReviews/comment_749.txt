Great choice for older travelers

I stayed 4 nights in early April at the Ambassador. I had a good quality room for the price: 20% discount for a 4-night stay, about 72.00/night USD for a single, including a huge and varied buffet in an attractive breakfast room each AM. A plus at breakfast--large carafes of hot coffee at each table.Just off the Ku-damm and the former middle of West Berlin, this hotel was perfect for the older traveler not looking for the nightlife of the Mitte, etc. It was close to U-Bahn, and an easy walk to Zoo train station and connections to the rest of Berlin and beyond.
