Best 3 stars I have ever stayed at

How this hotel is only a 3 stars is beyond me. I would say this is more like a 4 star hotel and certainly the best 3 star hotel I have ever stayed in. The staff are very helpful, professional and friendly. The decor is very tasteful, the location is great, the price is very good value, the mini bar was very reasonably priced, the hotel was exceptionally clean and the rooms were very quiet for such a centrally located hotel. I would certainly return to and recommend this hotel.
