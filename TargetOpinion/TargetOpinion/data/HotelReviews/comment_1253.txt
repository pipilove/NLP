Great hotel

This hotel is just excellent!! Location is perfect, the rooms were nice and clean. And the hotel staff is so friendly and helpful. I was really impressed about how service minded they were! My friends and I stayed for 4 nights and had nothing to complain about. I will definately book Chancellor for my next stay in SF!:)
