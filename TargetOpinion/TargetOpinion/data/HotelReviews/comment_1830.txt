great location, bad service

stayed at the darling harbour holiday inn. The location was great, right there at China town, restaurants everywhere, the monorail station is also nearby. Paddy's market is like 2 mins walk. Rooms were however very small. We were given the 1st floor rooms, and we were right under the monorail track, however noise was not a problem.Service is terrible. Staffs at the front desk were impatient, I made an enquiry about internet access from the room and the person on the phone was rude and unhelpful. Very shocking and unpleasant encounter.
