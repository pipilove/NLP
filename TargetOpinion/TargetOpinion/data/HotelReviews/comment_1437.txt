Avoid at all cost

We arrived at the hotel 2/7/2006 unfortunately at midnight because our flight was delayed. I was to attend a conference the next day. A non-smoking room as reserved was not available. When we arrived at the only room available at 12:30 AM the cleaning staff were in the room spraying it down with lysol and air refreshiner. The room reaked of ciagarette smoke which worsened if you turned on the fan or heat. Although I applaud them for their efforts, the combination was noxious. At 1:30AM the fire alarm in the room went off. After over an hour of deliberation with the front desk, security, and maintenace staff we finally got a non-smoking room at 2:30 AM. After the inconvenience of a delayed flight the inconvenience at the hotel was rather unwelcome and made my trip to SanFran rather unproductive. For $242 plus tax per night I would avoid this place like the plague. I had intended to write a letter to corporate but was told the hotel is no longer under management with Marriot and is in limbo with regard to management. Things are becoming a little more clear....
