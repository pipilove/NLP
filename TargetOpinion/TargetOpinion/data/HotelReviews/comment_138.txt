Dirty, Poor Management

First of all the location is good, no doubt about it. The food in the restaurant and the lobby are good too, but thats it. The quality of the rooms ( even in the renovated wing) are garbage. The management was very unaccommodating for any request made, and they were not big requests.The rooms were dirty, wore down, and just plain old and ugly. I wouldn't even walk barefoot throughout the room thats how bad it was.Reception was horrible and did not even try to be helpful with anything.Other than location, which isn't even that important considering the size of Amsterdam and easy transportation, this hotel is bad. The equivalent of about a 2 star hotel in the states.
