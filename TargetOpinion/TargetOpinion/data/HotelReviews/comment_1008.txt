truely disappointed

I must say this hotel was quite a disappointment compared to the accolades received on tripadvisor.There was no help with the luggage to the room, elevator was tiny, and could fit one person and one piece of luggage.My room was so small, I could barely move around. The shower stall was also very small.The location was out of the way for all my activities. I was just totally disappointed with the whole experience.I would never stay at this hotel again.The only positive thing about the hotel was the air conditioning, it worked and it was adapted to each room.
