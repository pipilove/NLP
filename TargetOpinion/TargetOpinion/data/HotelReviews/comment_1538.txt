As good as claimed

I booked a room at the Moore for two weekend nights thinking I would get one with a shared bathroom. Well, there were issues with the shared bathrooms (I never found out what they were) so the desk clerk gave me a complimentary upgrade to a room on the 7th floor with its own very small bathroom and a view of the city and Lake Union in the distance. It was very comfortable, warm and secure (which in Belltown is always an issue) and the location could not be better. I will definitely be back.
