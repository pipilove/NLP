Do not stay here

My husband and I stayed at a few hotels in Barcelona in May 2005, and we were extremely disappointed with the Royal Hotel. It is listed as a four-star hotel, and this is absolutely not the case. The room we got was VERY small (I would estimate 10 x 10 feet maximum) and the hotel looks like it hasn't been renovated in years. There was no view from our room (we looked onto a white wall that was about 5 feet away from our window), the room was musty and dark and the decor is very old and dank. The hotel is well-located in the heart of La Rambla, but this did not compensate for the poor upkeep and style of the hotel. The hotel lobby and reception desk are fine (although the photos make them look nicer than they actually are), but once you head up to your room, it is all downhill. I would strongly recommend finding another hotel in Barcelona because there are many with better value and better cleanliness.I would not even recommend this hotel to budget travellers or students, since it is relatively expensive. The only people that should stay here are people who only care about location and really want to be in the center of the city - you can walk almost anywhere from this hotel. Having said that, there are plenty of hotels in the neighborhood that may have nicer amenities at the same cost.
