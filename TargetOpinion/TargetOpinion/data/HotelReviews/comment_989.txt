Better avoid

My friend and I stayed at the Agora St.Germain in June and were quite disappointed. The woman who welcomed us was simply rude and unfriendly, although the rest of the staff was friendlier. Our room was small, with barely enough space to walk around the bed. Furniture was tasteless and not adequate (no single drawer, the closet was very small, only one chair). The bedspread looked like it hadn't been washed for a long while. The hotel has also larger and probably more comfortable rooms, more expensive than our standard double room (still, I don't feel that in a three-star hotel I should move up to the category superior, to get two proper chairs in a double room). The bathroom met the standards of a three-star hotel more than the rest. Still, it was very small (never been in a french three-star bathroom that didn't have a bidet); the door couldn't be locked, showering would produce a flood on the floor, and we experienced at least twice a sudden shortage of warm water, while taking shower. It was clean, but one couldn't call it spotless, as we could spot a variety of other guest' fingerprints on the door handle and towel hangers, and they were still there after one week. The location is of course very good, as other TripAdvisor users pointed out, but there are many other hotels nearby, and if you make your reservation well in advance (which we didn't do), you can have plenty of choice and definitely pick a better option.
