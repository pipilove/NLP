Not so inviting Estherea

Stayed here for two nights. I have been to Amsterdam several times but i found it difficult to find at first and a bit isolated on the way back in the evening. When we checked in i had forgotten my visa card so i paid cash up front... no problem but the guy at the front desk was rude beyond believe.He demanded 250 euro deposit per night and for me thats alot when you are only on a weekend break and it was unexpected. I had to give him 400 euro in the end. This left us with very little cash. When we were shown to our room it was tiny really small. The end of the bed was 1 foot from the wall and there was less than a foot either side of the room.We thought there was no bathroom and when we opened the door to what we thought was a wardrobe it was actually a toilet and tiny bath. When you closed the toilet door there was a 4inch gap really nice.I spoke to the front desk and they said they would change rooms the next day and to be fair they did give us a nice room at the top of the house.I did not enjoy this hotel at all i found the staff rude and unhelpful and the facilates poor.Watch what room you get i did request and pay for a deluxe to start with however there idea of deluxe is a view of the canal.This hotel is not worthy of a four star more basic 3 star
