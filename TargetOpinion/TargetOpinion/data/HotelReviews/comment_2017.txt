well placed

Having spent the previous week in a hostel this was a taste of sanity, not that the hostel was bad, just that the hotel was spacious and had certain luxuries like a microwave, fridge, large bathroom, and, well, was just `more`. Also had a T.V. and table. 13th floor view wasn`t up to much though. On every second floor there is also a vending machine which sells sweeties and instant junk, while the reception also has a selection of frozen microwaveable junk if you ask. Reception, although very helpful, patient and humourful, could have been a bit better staffed at times as the waiting times were a bit riduculous, even if, or especially as, they do have 400+ rooms. Centrally located for the train station, tube stations, pubs, china town , Darling Harbour and internet cafe`s, the hotel is also within 30 mins walking distance of all the attractions of Sydney, the furthest being the opera house, but it is quite enjoyable if taken through the parks. The hotel has a room for luggage. Airport bus will come and pick you up for a fare. Breakfast buffet is okay, everything you would expect is there. Would go there again, if I ever get the opportunity.
