Excellent stay!

My husband, daughter, and I stayed at the Castle Inn for 2 nights last month. The service there was fantastic. We got great food recommendations (Versa even made reservations for us and called us when we were out and about sightseeing to let us know what time they were for!) and plenty of help with directions and suggestions for what to do and see. The rooms were perfectly adequate, clean, and comfortable. The only down side to our stay (and it was a small one) is that they don't have cribs there. Even still, we would stay there again without hestitation. Great service, great location, free parking ... great stay!
