Changed since Julie left!

Having stayed at this extremely convenient hotel in the Rue de Monge during the tenure of Julie I was interested to see what difference the owners had made.Rooms appear to be unaltered but reception and breakfast area now a bordelo crimson red.Believe it is now family run but there was a distinct lack of visible staff apart from the occasional head of someone sitting behind the reception desk. At no time did any member of staff address us or ask if everything was OK. Breakfast overpriced at 11 Euros and totally self service with not a member of staff on hand.Would I stay again - probably, if only for its location to central Paris, restaurants and the Metro.
