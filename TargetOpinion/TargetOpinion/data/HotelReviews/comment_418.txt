Do Not Waste Your Money

 I am amazed that this hotel has a four star rating. It lacks everthing that a four star hotel should have. The pool is very small and the gymnasium should not be a feature. The noise of traffic is unbearable as it is located on a busy road. There is a very small bar in the reception, but there is no bar staff and if you want a drink the porter has to fetch someone from the restaurant upstairs. The rooms are very small, but clean I have to say. The most dissapointing thing was the staff. Every member of staff was rude and unhelpful. One example, was when we asked for toothpaste which is a little sachet provided at the beginning of the stay. Our request was refused and there was nowhere local to find toothpaste. Were were also charged â‚¬63 for car parking in possible the tightest car park in the world!!
