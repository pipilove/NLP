Really poor quality--A very bad stay.

I'm not so sure why so many people rate the Mediterranean Inn as well as they do. This is one of those hotels that's all about show and very little about quality. I chose to stay at the hotel because of the generally positive feedback from TripAdvisor and the overall appearance of the hotel based on the pictures I had seen. But upon arrival, it was obvious that the hotel would be lacking. Generally unlean, tacky decor, and the bare minimum of comforts define the hotel. I've stayed in many Best Westerns that are superior in these regards. Our room was tiny and bed uncomfortable and overly springy, with old and dirty looking sheets. The window was tiny, and despite what you see in the pictures, there are no balconies--just made to look that way. Our refrigerator didn' t work, there was no air conditioning, and despite a temperate 70 degree day in Seattle, the whole place managed to be stuffy and uncomfortable. One of the elevators was broken the whole stay as well. The staff were generally unconcerned about things and there never seemed to be enough of them to handle things properly. The price is less than many other quality hotels in Seattle, but don't make the mistake of comparing this hotel to anything nice. Compare it to a Best Western or Ramada Inn, and you'll still be far happier at one of those.
