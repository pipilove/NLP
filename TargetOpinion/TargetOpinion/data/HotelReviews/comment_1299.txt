Just average

An average hotel, I can't see why it is rated no 3 in San Francisco. It does have good size rooms, good location  some of the doorman are friendly  helpful. But the decor is tired  the breakfast isn't worth it. Pay for room only  eat your breakfast somewhere else. Also found that you had to ask for coffee at breakfast, it was never offered. Some people describe this hotel as a Boutique hotel, it isn't. It's not modern enough  no thought has gone into the decor.If you stay here you will neither be impressed or annoyed, as I've already said it's just an average hotel and you can pay less for an average hotel.
