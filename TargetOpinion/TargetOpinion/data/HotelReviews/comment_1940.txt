Great Locate

We recently stayed at the Swissotel Sydney and it easily has one of the best locations in the city. This is a great city to explore shopping, restaurants, and other parts of the city. For those who are foodies you will be pleased to know that their chief concierge Jason will recommend a restaurant based on his experience of going there, he avoids recommending restaurants that are touristy. My partner and I travel for food among other things  both of us were concierges in the past so this was a pleasant surprised. On the last leg of our trip we stayed at another hotel  Jason was still willing to help us with tours, reservations, etc. Jason  the staff go above  beyond.The hotel  the rooms are contemporary  beds are comfortable. You should definitely consider staying here while you are in Sydney.
