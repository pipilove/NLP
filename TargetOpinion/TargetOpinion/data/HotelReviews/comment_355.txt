Not really 5 star

Stayed at this hotel for a short break with my 15 year old daughter. Our first meal at the poolside restaurant was very poor quality and mine I returned, whilst the meal we experienced at the Enoteca Restarant left both of us with upset stomachs. The room service was useless, an inability to co-ordinate the coffee facilities so that cups, saucers, milk and teaspoon were all available at the same time prevailed for our entire stay. It took two days and several visits from a rather sweaty and smelly engineer (with very dirty shoes) to get the shower working properly. The in-room toiletries had already been used by a previous guest. The lifts broke (luckily we were only on the 5th floor). One day the room was not made up until just before bedtime and on another day it was not made up at all. The final ineptitude was the staff managing to lose our suitcases between the reception area and the taxi area as we were leaving which resulted in our having to rummage around the hotel baggage store.We did speak with the hotel duty manager on our final night and he was kind enough to reimburse us the cost of the Enoteca dinner, give us a further small discount and offer us the use of our room until 4pm on the day of our departure. However the shambles continued even after that conversation and we left after what should have been a relaxing stay at a luxury hotel, rather stressed and relieved to be leaving.It was not a five star experience and certainly not one that I could recommend to others.
