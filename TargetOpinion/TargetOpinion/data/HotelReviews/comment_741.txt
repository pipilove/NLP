Great Service, Perfect Location

The Berlin Grand Hyatt lives up to the GrandHyatt name.Location: very central for business and lesiuire traveller, around the corner there are rows of decent restaurants. The Concierge is excellent in recommending good restraurants. Dont' hesitate to ask. 5 mins to Posdamer Platz station. Mall, cinema and even Casino is around the cornr.Rooms: clean, sleek, grand. BO flat screen TV  sound system. not extremely spacious for our Grand Twin room.The bathroom is spacious with tub and a rainshower cubical.Bathroom amenties are from Aveda. But the housekeeping staff was very mingy, not putting new or additional shower gel and moisturizer, she just screwed the cap back and put them there. Very disappointing. The room offers a good variety of tea and coffee making facilities. Internet is NOT WiFi. 18 Euro per day.Didn't use the business center, so no idea about the efficiency.Breakfast at Vox, selection is impressive. THe service is immaculate. The doormen are very courteous, cheerful, they truly extend that welcome everyday, not just aiming for tips.All in all , it's a great choice for Berlin, We have got a reasonable rate of E295 for the room w breakfast. I consider it pretty good.We kept one of our bags with Grand Hyatt after checking out on our 4-day trip to Prague. The Bell staff are very acommodating, the doorman saw us return, without a word, he rushed to get our bag out. impressive.
