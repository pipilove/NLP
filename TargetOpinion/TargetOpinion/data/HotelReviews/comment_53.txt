Very Nice Hotel

This is very nice hotel that exceeded our expectations. We had a spacious room(#507) that faced the canal, it really couldn't have been nicer. We especially liked the free coffee and snacks in the lobby. The staff was always helpful and went above and beyond. I asked for simple directions for driving and the staff member got online and printed out mapquest directions for me, very nice!One important item that is not mentioned on their website is that a trolly runs close by from the central train station. If you take the train from the Airport(very easy), you get off at Central Station and catch the #2 trolly. This will take you steps from the hotel. We tried to get a taxi from the train station and they wanted to double the price because it wasn't that far of a drive. Only because we didn't know about the trolly at that time.
