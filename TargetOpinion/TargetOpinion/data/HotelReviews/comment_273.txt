On returning to Amsterdam after several years we were looking for a small and intimate hotel to celebrate Valentine's Day - the Seven Bridges Hotel was perfect ! This is a small hotel with a number of canalside bedrooms with stunning views - each of the bedrooms is individually designed and furnished with antique furniture. There are no public rooms - a large and filling breakfast is brought to your bedroom on Villeroy  Bosch crockery and this just adds to the charm. The hotel is well situated for all the tourist attractions and yet is in a quiet street. The hotel website gives a true impression of the property with plenty of photographs of the wonderful bedrooms. It was easy to book directly with the owners, who were very helpful. Would we return - absolutely, we can't wait !Recommended for romantic breaks, couples, and anyone who likes an individual hotel with character. Not recommended for disabled or anyone who has difficulty with steep stairs.
