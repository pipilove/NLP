Great Value and location

Great Hotel if you want to be in the heart of San Francisco and yet away from all the traffic noise. This is in the Financial district which is only a few blocks away from Union Square. So on weekends everything dies down and you can enjoy peaceful suroundings. Very well appointed rooms, excellent service and way cheaper than some of the other big names that are not as nice on the interior. We had some loud partying neighbours and finally called the front desk at 11:45 pm and they took care of it immedately. Only issue is that Valet parking fee is $51 per 24 hrs - WOW! Suggest street parking on weekends which is free or the St Mary's Garage close by which is $6.50 per weekend night. You are out of luck on weekdays as parking is expensive everywhere.
