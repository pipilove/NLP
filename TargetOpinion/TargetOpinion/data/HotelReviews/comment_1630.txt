W / A Business Stay

Dimly lit facilites and noisy rooms. Not an appropriate hotel for a business trip with hosted business meetings actually in the hotel.Heard neighbors next door and upstairs through very thin walls and floors. Very good room service food. No issues with billing, and mostly helpful staff.Bottom line: Great location but very noisy. Not a good place for business meetings
