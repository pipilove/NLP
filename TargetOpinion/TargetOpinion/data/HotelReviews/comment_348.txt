Staff were great, a bonus when you are travelling with a 3 year old. Rooms were surprisingly dowdy and old fashioned given the fantastic lobby, bar, restaurant etc areas. Maybe a tad on the overpriced side of things but we enjoyed it well enough. Altho be warned that it is not very central for the attractions.
