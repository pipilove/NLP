Service needs to be revamped, Location is prime!

The location is right in the City center opposite to Hyde Park which offers easy access to corporate offices and downtown shopping. Major Stores and malls e.g. QVB, Strand Arcade, Pitt Street mall and Sydney Towers are within 5mins walks. City ourist attractions is close by . However, the service is just very average. Even this propety is more of a buisness hotel, there are rooms for such claimed to be 5-star property to improve.I rushed out in the morning forgot to remove the 'Don't Disturb' sign one morning which blocked the housekeeping staff to clean the room. Upon my return at night, I called Guest service and I was astound to hear that the housekeeping staff were off after 6pm!?! They could only bring clean towels and unable to clean the cups and change linens. I expect at least one houisekeeping staff on duty after hours!!! That's not 5-star business hotel.The room is spacious, but for twin room, I expect at least two queen beds, instead it is really a twin. The bathroom is spacious with limited counter top space for personal items. Overall it is just an OK experience.
