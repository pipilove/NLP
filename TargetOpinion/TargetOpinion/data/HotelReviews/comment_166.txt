Excellent location

Stayed here with a friend for a weekend. Excellent location right opposite Central Station so no long walk to do with your bags. Room was decent with good bathroom and very comfortable beds. The staff are superb and cannot do enough for you. Only moan is the breakfast - far too expensive and most of it was cold as it is a buffet style and left in tins etc etc. There is an excellent breakfast cafe around the corner - English breakfast for 6 euros. I can recommend the cocktails in the front bar. We went on a river boat dinner cruise which is an excellent way to see Amsterdam by night - very pretty.
