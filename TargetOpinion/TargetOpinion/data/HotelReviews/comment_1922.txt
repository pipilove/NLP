The Finale After 5 Reviews

After writing 5 reviews of this hotel and having first stayed here in 1985 it is finally over. Each visit in the last few years has shown a more tired, less professional, shabbier and incredibly a more pretentious hotel. As the hotel has declined the staff has become more haughty. Particularly the front desk which has a collection of snooty youngsters with a total lack of a service mind set. An early arrival is always fraught with problems (one has little choice about when to arrive due to airline schedules). To be lectured on the official check in time is not much appreciated after a long and sleepless journey. Paying top dollar for a corner full harbor and opera house view room (which we always book) the one we were finally given (1709) after 2 hours of housekeeping and being totally ignored for over 3 hours was hardly the spectacular view of previous rooms we have enjoyed. If you looked to the left from the small window you saw the bridge, if you looked to the right the opera house! For that and a old Nokia TV (yes Nokia) and shabby sofa with stains you pay $600 per night. Still charging for internet for premium rooms this once great hotel which stood above all others in Sydney has finally hit the bottom and after 23 years of patronage this is one customer who will never return. Kables is not worth eating in any more.Even the shabby room could have been tolerated with a more cordial and helpful reception. We stay at Four Seasons Hotels throughout the world and this one has now become an embarassment to the brand. The front desk would be a scandal at Courtyard by Marriott. Each review we have written has shown a rapid deterioration of service and ammenities. The bathrooms and marble showers are still wonderful and the beds are comfortable but those things can be found at many other hotels in Sydney. Goodbye, Four Seasons Sydney- you are not what you used to be and we are now researching a new hotel for the next visit to Sydney.
