location good

Excellent location. Walking distance to Louvre, bus tours departure point, restaurants and shops. Our only disappointment was we were in room number one. It was on the ground floor next to reception. We could hear people walking past and the phone ringing in reception. We checked in at 5.30pm and our room wasn't ready we were told to come back in an hour. No offer of shower or anything. We enquired about ordering a taxi for 9am and the reception incorrectly ordered it immediately - we weren't even packed and had to rush. If booking be sure to state that you do not want a ground floor room. All that aside - we were so busy looking at sights that we didn't spend much time in the room. It was small.
