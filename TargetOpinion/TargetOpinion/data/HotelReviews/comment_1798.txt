Bed Bugs!

I stayed here due to the mostly very good reviews I found online. However after 2 nights here, I received over 10 bed bug bites, 2 on each of my hands, 4 on my back and 5 more on my arms! I can't believe I paid over $130 for this experience and it's taking over a week for the bites to go away. I called and complained and am hoping they have done something about it.
