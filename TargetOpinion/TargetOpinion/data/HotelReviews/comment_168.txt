Okay hotel, but rooms need refurbishing

We stayed here for two nights in July 2008. The location is excellent and perfect if you have an early train journey the next morning! The reception and lobby is very nice, however I thought that the rooms let the hotel down a bit and need refurbishing. We stayed in the garden wing, and as I'd read some reviews on here, I was aware some guests had seen mice in this area of the hotel. I didn't see any myself, but there were some strange noises in the room during the night!We didn't eat at all in the hotel, but in a nice italian restaurant (if you stand facing the hotel, turn right and you'll find it up a side street). We also ate breakfast on the same street in a pancake place. I think this was all much cheaper than eating in the hotel. Overall I would recommend staying in the hotel if you need to be near the station, but otherwise next time I would try somewhere else.
