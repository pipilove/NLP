Very nice place

We spent 3 nights in the Castle Inn's only suite. It is not a fancy hotel but was perfect for four people (two adults with two teenagers). The suite is more like an apartment and has two good sized clean rooms each with a king sized bed. There is a good sized bath and huge walk-in closet. The larger of the rooms also had two sofas and two chairs. The second room is off of a hallway--good for privacy. The suite has a small refrigerator with separate freezer, microwave, iron and board. We used a roll-away in the larger room for one of the teenagers. It was far better than the usual roll-away. More like a twin bed on wheels. The cost of the suite was far less than two separate rooms would have been and if we found two rooms at another hotel for what we paid for the suite, I am sure that they would not be nearly as nice. The Castle Inn is located in the Russian Hill area of the city, a vibrant and convenient neighborhood with many varied restaurants within a few block walk. We felt more like we were living like locals than staying at a hotel. The free covered parking is a big plus. Cable cars are nearby, only 21/2 blocks. We bought 3 day city transportation passes at $18 each and used them a lot, a bargain particularly since the cable cars are otherwise $5/ride. Fisherman's wharf was a pleasant walk and also a great cable car ride away. Desk staff could not have been nicer or more helpful. Altogether, the Casle Inn is a fine choice.
