One of the best Travelodges

I found this hotel to be modern, clean, good value and with relatively spacious rooms with microwave oven and a few added bonuses. For a travelodge (don't expect five stars) this reprensents a decent affordable stay in on of the worlds great cities.The only real downside to this hotel is it's location in one of the poorer more eastern areas of central Sydney. but i feel this hotel is good value with good service and i would definately stay here again.
