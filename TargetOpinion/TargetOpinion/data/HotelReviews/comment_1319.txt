Overpriced with tiny rooms

This hotel isn't worth the price. Rooms are very small, traffic is horrible, and service is poor. Beware the hotel room doors that open out into the hallway - we almost got smacked! We booked online, and paid extra ($449) to get a room that was supposed to have a Golden Gate Bridge view. We were very disappointed in the room, which was so narrow that only a small passage existed between the end of the bed  the wall. As for the view, you could see a smidgen of the bridge, if you looked past the noisy street, through the trees, and if you leaned to the left and hunkered down a little. I looked at thefire evacuation map on the back of the main door and saw that our room was one of the smallest on the floor. I went back to the front desk and asked the manager on duty if we could have a larger room or one with a view. He condescendingly explained that hotel rooms in bigcities like San Francisco tend to be smaller than rooms in places like Las Vegas. He ended up giving us a somewhat larger (but not spacious) room with a nice Alcatraz view. The hotel is centrally located at Fisherman's Wharf, but that means getting to and from the hotel is a nightmare of traffic snarls with the accompanying noise and pollution.Valet parking was terrible, too. When I left our car with the valet,I asked how long it would take to get it back. He said to call 5-10 minutes ahead. When we requested our car around 5 pm, it was a 20 minute wait.We ordered room service breakfast, which arrived on time, but lacked presentation. The croissant was naked on a plate (no cover, no plastic wrap, just out in the open), and we got no jam, no butter, no glass of water, nothing.The shower head is mounted terribly high on the wall. I'm 5'5, and could barely reach it. The shower curtain was mounted on a straight rod, and kept billowing in while I showered.
