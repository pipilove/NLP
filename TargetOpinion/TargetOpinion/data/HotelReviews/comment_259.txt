Disgusted

We just returned from a 2-night stay at the Swissotel. We were extremely disappointed with this hotel, after reading great reviews on this site and elsewhere. Our room, requested as non-smoking, smelled very smoky, and it was also very dirty--dirty carpet, dirty bathroom, etc. Scaffolding and plastic was our 'view' outside our window. Our bathtub did not drain properly and spewed sewage when we ran the faucet. After complaining to the condescending manager, our rate was reduced by 10 E a night. We were not at all happy with this hotel or its treatment of us. Also, it was very noisy at night, with noise coming from the carnival at the Dam square, and the tram which runs right outside the hotel, as well as from the generally very busy street outside.Pro: It is an easy walk from the train station and convenient to restaurants, shopping, sights, etc. That is the only reason I give this hotel two stars.
