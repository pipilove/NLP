Terrible Service

We booked a long weekend at the Grand Marina and on arrival were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the rooms. Very modern with a seperate lounge area and comfortable. The rooms were spacious and everything was fine. The problems started when we went to check out on the final day. We had a flight booked at 8pm on the Sunday and so, wanting to enjoy our final day in the city, checked out and left our bags with the concierge. He presented us with a ticket for the bags and off we went for lunch. On our return, we presented the ticket and expected to get our bag. The concierge could not find our bag and a phonecall soon after confirmed that a gentleman at Barcelona airport had found our bag in the boot of his taxi when he got to the airport. The only option had been for him to ask the taxi driver to return the case to the hotel. Honesty in Barcelona is not a strong quality and the bag had never arrived back at the Grand Marina. We were getting nowhere with the management of the hotel who clearly did not care and so that we did not miss our flight, we left for the airport empty handed with the promise of an explaination from the manager the following day.Back in the UK we made a claim with our insurers but needed to get confirmation from the hotel of the events that took place. We made call after call to the hotel who would never allow me to speak with the manager. I emailed the hotel asking for confirmation and again received nothing. All in all the service after the loss, for which they were responsible was awful. In the end, I managed to get a friend who was working in Barcelona to visit the hotel in person and stand over the manager whilst he wrote an email confirming events. If I had not had this friend do this, I would never have got the claim through.In summary, whilst the hotel is well positioned and the rooms are lovely, the service and attitude of the staff and management is appalling.
