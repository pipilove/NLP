Nice Enough - Make Sure You Use The SAFE!

Nice enough hotel, clean and fairly well located. The only problem was that my partner had her necklace stollen from our room, they claimed that it was our fault because we had not put it in the safe provided! We even put the do not disturb sign on the door and they still went into the room to clean. Apparently they have to go into every room at least once a day as previously somebody died i a room and went un-noticed for 3 days. Breakfast was a dissapointment and would NOT recommend paying the æ‹¢15 for it. The swimming pool on the roof is nice enough although very small (a lot smaller than it appears from the photos) and can get very busy as the roof terrace is quite small.Overall not a bad hotel, smart, clean and helpful staff, if you do stay here be sure to lock everything in the safe! They also have security deposit boxes which are in reception, these require 2 keys, one for you and the hotel keep the other and these are big enough for a laptop - I would recommend using them and not leaving anything lying around. Oh and there is free Wi Fi connection which is good.
