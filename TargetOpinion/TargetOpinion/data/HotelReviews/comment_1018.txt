Great Hotel

This hotel was great. The location was right by the Arc de Truimph and a metro stop. Plenty of restaurants and shopping nearby. The rooms were nice. There was construction in the lobby, but didn't mind it too much. The airline lost our luggage and we didn't have any idea where it was. The staff spent the last two days tracking it down for us and calling the airport. They were extremely helpful in getting our luggage. Without them I would have probably given up-- kudos to them. would highly recommend this hotel.
