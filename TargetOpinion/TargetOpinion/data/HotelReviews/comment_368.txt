Amazing room, Bad service

The room is AMAZING. The view of the harbor, the ipod connected stereo system, the amazing shower, the comfy bed, the flatscreen tv, the electric window shades, etc, all means one word: SUPERCOOL. Even the hotel location is okay, because the tourist bus (the BEST way to get around the city) has a stop just outside the hotel. However, beware the service. The concierge is soooooooo busy, especially at weekends that we found it quicker to call restaurants ourselves (we even got better tables by calling ourselves). One time, the concierge did not even call us back. And when we asked for a US adapter for our laptop, it took 45 minutes and three calls to get it. Not what you would expect for a place like this. If they could improve the service, this would be a top hotel even on a world-level standard. With the service as it is, it's worth the money, but only just.
