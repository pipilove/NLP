Expensive

After reading mixed reviews I decided to stay here anyway. Partly because of the location, and partly because of the leisure facilities. I booked my room direct with the hotel and did pay and extortionate 390 euros per night. This was for an executive suite. MY first impression was the very friendly hotel staff. I walked in my room and was pleasantly suprised by the very large and well appointed room. I was quite happy.The following moring I decided to take half an hour in the sauna. Shocked to find a 9 euro charge to use it. Not only that 11euros an hour for the gym.After returning to my room after the first day i found the housekeeping very poor. The bed looked like it had be straightened as opposed to made. Bathroom had not at all been cleaned. and there was a glass that i had used still on the worktop. This stayed there for the whole 3 days.The second day the bed was infact changed (had spilt juice on the pillow) altho the cover was left in a heap on the sofa.Also lots of earyl moring noise for building work outside.Great location for centre of amsterdam.Excellent reception stafff.Poor house keeping.Good breakfast (20 euros though)
