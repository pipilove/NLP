Ideal base for sight-seeing

Arriving late at night was not a problem. The staff were friendly enough. We were very surprised by the size of the rooms. A lot more space than most European hotels. Good shower and bath and toilet was separate to bathroom which was handy. Nice to have a fridge in the room as well. It was also very quiet as we didn't hear noise from other rooms. It's a great location for sightseeing. It's a 5 minute walk from Potsdamer Platz which has lots of shops etc for everything and Checkpoint Charlie. On the downsides the air-conditioning in our room wasn't working and if you have the windows open the buses can be a tad annoying during the night.Staff didn't seem to be too knowledgeable about the area. We wanted to go to see a Doctor/outpatients and they didn't know where the closest were and also weren't too helpful re pharmacists close by.On the whole we would definitely stay there again as we booked through the hotel's website and it was a bargain for 3 nights. Would also reccommend Bistro Stressemann across the road from the hotel for a breakfast or a late night drink and would highly reccommend a restaurant called Vapiano at Potsdamer Platz (it was so good we ate there two nights) for pizza/pasta/salads.
