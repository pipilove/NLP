Old section getting a bit long in the tooth

I travel to San Francisco at least once every year and have been staying in Starwood hotels since I joined their club about five years ago. I have bounced between the W, St. Regis  St. Francis. What I do like about the St. Francis is the old section overlooking Union Square because the ceilings are high and the rooms have that sense of old San Francisco that I remember as a child staying there with my family. However, the best part is that the windows open wide letting in the cool S.F. air and the sounds of the city complete with the clanging cable cars traveling up and down Powell St. A view over Union Square to Tiffanys, Macys  Nieman is so cIt y. It really doesn't get much better than that for a city experience. If you can time it right be sure to book a lower Union Square room to watch the Chinese New Year parade from your window.What I don't like about the St. Francis is that the new gourmet retaurant that has taken over what was one of the most wonderful hotel bars in the city. Nothing against the restaurant itself as I have yet to dine there. Cocktails are now relegated to the lobby which diminishes what was once a Grand entrance. Now the lobby is kept impossibly dim littered with too warn, never were attractive furnishings.All in all, I will probably opt sometime again in the future for the Union Square experience; but I do miss the bathrooms at the St. Regis.
