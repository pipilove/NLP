Very happy with our stay

The location is absolutely ideal for a tourist trip to Berlin. So much is within walking distance, and that which is not is easily reached by transit. There are restaurants nearby, and plently of shopping. The hotel is a great building. We too, noticed the sound of the piano player in the evening, but this isn't the worst sound to have wafting into your room! Although I would think they could stop it a little earlier in the evening. Our room was very nicly furnished and clean with a large bathroom.Our rate inclued and extensive buffet breakfast - VERY nice, with an omlette bar and wide variety of hot and cold foods. I beleive they charge 24Euros for it if it is not included. I wouldn't pay that, but try to get a rate that includes breakfast!
