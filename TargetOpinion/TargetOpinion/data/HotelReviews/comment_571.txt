Avoid but...

The hotel is nice and the spot is ideal: you're IN the city. But the service is totally different with so many rooms for improvement it became not acceptable. Room cleaning was not done at 4:30pm! Room cleaning involves your active action: there is always something missing! Spa really need to be cleaned (avoid the hammam). Breakfast service is unefficient say rude and even if food is abudant, avoid quality. Do you want an umbrella, they do not have - Do insist: they have some! And finally, rooms are really noisy! The price is the one of a 5stars in BCN. But you pay for the place as the service is an up-3stars. Prefer the Neri or Le MÃ©ridien or, for excellent service: La Florida or the Arts (but then forget the city!).
