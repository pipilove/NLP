Lovely and quiet

We spent two nights over a weekend here after making a decision to not stay in the Darling Harbour area where we have stayed many times previously. This hotel had great service, no check in or check out problems, very quiet and bright airy rooms and very pleasant and friendly, helpful and efficient staff. This is a superb location close to the city centre, minutes walk from Circular Key and The Rocks, and within easy distance of other areas if you desire. Having stayed in 10 international hotels in the last year this rates as being the equal with many others.
