Dreadfull Hotel

My parents stayed at this hotel last year and found it to be excellent and this is why I chose this hotel.BUT while the bed was Comfortable and the room tidy it was very noisy due to overlooking the back laneway. I was allocated a non smoking room but torists were smoking on the floor so smelled strongly of cigarette smoke.Room was booked direct with Hotel (not their website) and credit card number taken so room could be charged to the card. I was advised this was all fine. HOWEVER on arriving at hotel was told this was not noted on their records and I would have to pay cash for the room plus a A$100 deposit before they would hand over the room keys.Staff on front desk extremely rude and uncoperative. I intend to tell all my friends about this hotel and myself or none of my family will every stay at a here again.
