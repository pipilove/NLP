Great Location and a great hotel

We stayed at the Montecarlo in October 2007. We were very pleased withthe hotel. It has been redecorated in a modern theme which we liked and has some nice touches such as adjustable beds, robes and slippers,and electic rollup blalckout shades.The location is super, Even though it is on the La Rambla, it is very quiet and we were never bothered by street noise. The desk staff was most knowledgeable and quite helpful.We did not opt for the breakfast as it was not included in the price of the room. There a several places close by that are cheaper.I don't think you can beat this hotel for its location and price and for what you get for your money. We would definitely stay there again.
