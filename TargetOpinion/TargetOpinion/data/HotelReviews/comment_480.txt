Loved the bath!!

Just back from a 4 night stay in the Grand Marina and like most people have already said was of a good quality. Unfortunately we never had the luck of some people who got upgraded to a suite but none-the-less the superior room was of a decent size and finish with nice complimentary toiletries to boot!!One negative was the fact that they had turned the air-con off throughout the hotel due to the fact that it was winter - however with the temperature still peaking at 23 degrees during the day it did tend to get a bit stuffy in the room at times though a nice breeze could be got by going out to the balcony ( though no such promised picturesque view).We also had the misfortune of losing our baggage but the concierge proved most helpful in tracking it down and dropping it into the room on it's arrival.After a long days sightseeing the massage bath is just the job to ease all those aches and pains.There was a lack of english speaking TV stations but I guess you don't go there to watch the telly. The room cleanliness was second to none with our room getting tidied TWICE a day!Overall a very pleasant stay.
