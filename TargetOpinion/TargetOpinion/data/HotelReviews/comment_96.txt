worst hotel ever 

i had the worst stay ever in this hotel. i had planed a relaxing 10 day vacation with one of my friends and when i got to the hotel they needed my credit card just to confirm the room is what they told me but no they charged 1500 euro to my card and that put a block on my card for 10 days to wait for the authorization and by the time i left today ...yes that is today they still had not figured it out and told me that i could not leave until the bill was resolved.. all in all bad room service bad,customer service bad , and everything was overpriced i paid 15 euro for a pot of water and 1 tea bag ...not good so i would not suggest to stay at this hotel
