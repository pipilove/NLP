Nice, clean, convenient hotel in Berlin

I was quite pleased with this hotel. Like one of the other reviewers, I was also impressed that the room was ready when I arrived in the morning. They even left some sugar energy tablet things on the pillow to help get over jet lag.The price was very reasonable and included daily buffet breakfast and wireless internet access. The breakfast had something for everybody (European and American breakfast foods). The staff were very helpful; I needed to print something, and they let me print it for free in their business center. There is a tiny elevator, which is nice if you have a heavy suitcase. They have a decent restaurant just off the lobby, and while they don't do room service (contrary to what the hotel information book in the room says), you can order something and go down to pick it up and take back to your room. One thing I didn't realize until the end of my stay was that there is a grocery store just down the street, so if you don't want to pay minibar charges, you can go buy your own water and snacks.As far as location, this was a nice neighborhood and convenient to the subway, restaurants, shopping, etc. I was a female traveling alone, and I felt perfectly safe walking around there at night. The room was about the normal size for Europe (i.e. small), but very clean and with a window that could open. I didn't hear any noise from outside. The walls are a little thin, though, so if you're a light sleeper, you might want to bring ear plugs to protect you from your neighbor's late-night television, discussions, etc. I stayed there for business and then a few days being a tourist. The only warning I have to offer is if you want to sleep past 8 AM, make sure you hang the do not disturb sign on your door. The uber-efficient cleaning staff will attempt multiple times to clean your room if you don't have the sign displayed.
