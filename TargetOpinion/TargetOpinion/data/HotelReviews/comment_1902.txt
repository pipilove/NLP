Not a hotel for leisure clients

We checked into the hotel at 18.30 on a week night (this August - stayed two nights) and were told that our room was not ready yet (check in time at the hotel is 14.00). We got given some coupons for a drink at the bar and were given a room at 19.30. We had requested and paid a Harbour view (the receptionist was actually on the verge of giving me a city view but I think she noticed I was extremely angry at the time and somehow found one harbour view available). Nice views and a good sized room and an extremely comfortable bed...It has a very corporate look to the whole hotel. We had opted out of breakfast which was a good decision in the end as the queues for the buffet were outrageous! Plenty of breakfast places nearby. We thought the hotel was mainly for corporate clients and did not feel extremely welcoming for leisure guests. I would not recomend this hotel for tourists wanting to spend a few days in Sydney as it has not got a relaxed feel to the hotel and one can get better 4* hotels for the price (eg. Radisson Plaza Sydney, great hotel!).
