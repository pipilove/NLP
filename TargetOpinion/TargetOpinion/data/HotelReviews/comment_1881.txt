Sheraton 'Lite'

A disappointing end to our great trip to Australia - this is a very big and impersonal hotel - full of Asian Tour Groups and a convention when we stayed. They kept asking whether we were with the convention at every restaurant and breakfast service was very slow and ordinary. Not really a Sheraton in terms of standards and the staff very rude and unhelpful.
