Fabulous Hotel

This hotel was more than what we expected. Terrific staff, very nice, clean, and spacious room! The Executive Lounge was excellent----wide variety of food----all day long! Everyone wanted to bend over backwards for us. Concierge provided friendly, helpful tips and accurate directions. Nightly turn down service included sumptuous chocolates and other delicacies. The hotel stay definitely made our family vacation even more memorable!
