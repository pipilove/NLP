EXCELLENT

beautiful room all i gotta say that it is an excellent concept of a hotel chain. there is a review from this guy describing the room, i definately agree with him. the room was beautiful, it feels like a studio, really funky design. they give you free croissants and coffee, tea in the morning and free 15 minute massages on thursdays which left my husband really relaxed. the location was good too! very happy and reasonable price! definately stay there!
