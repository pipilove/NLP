Amazing Hotel!

This was my second time after 2 years at Banks Mansion.The Hotels is great and it is my favourite city Hotel right now in Europe.Great room with free minibar and spirits of your choice but what is really amazing is the staff..from the GM of the Hotel to the people of the reception they are all helpfull and do always their best to please the guests with more than a smile. The location is also great as all the major sights are in walking distance. Looking forward to stay again at the Banks Mansion.
