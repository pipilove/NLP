Horrible Service, Nice Building

My wife and I spent two nights at the Hotel 1898 in early Oct. 2007. I am a frequent business traveler both within the US and internationally and have experience with many hotels (Four Seasons, Starwood, Ritz Carlton, etc...).Hotel 1898 is part of a chain of upscale boutique hotels in Spain. The pluses are that the hotel is in nice condition with clean rooms and good looking common spaces (including 2 pools). Our experience was ruined, however, by the incredibly unhelpful staff at Hotel 1898 who seemed to go out of their way to be outright rude to us - for instance, my wife called to ask if the conceirge could make a dinner reservation for us. Four hours later, we had heard nothing so she called again. The concierge responded by snapping that they were very busy and would call when they got around to it - by the time they did, the restaurant was fully booked. Another major problem was that the Hotel was simply mismanaged - although the check-in time was 3pm, the hotel refused to check us in at that time saying that the rooms were not clean. We were not able to check in until over two hours later and the hotel offered us no recompense for this significant inconvenience aside from one drink at the bar. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone as the service is horrendous.
