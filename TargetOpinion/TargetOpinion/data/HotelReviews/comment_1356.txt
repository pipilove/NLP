Great Hotel, Great Location

We booked this hotel as a result of the excellent tripadvisor reviews it had received and we are glad to report they were accurate!!We stayed in a bayview room which had a superb view,overlooking the Hyde Powell Cable car turnaround and the Golden Gate Bridge.The staff were very helpful and friendly and the room was spotlessly clean. We really enjoyed the evening wine tasting and would have no hesitation in staying again
