Basic Accomodations With No Frills

We stayed at the Castle Inn in June 2008. The location is convenient to tourist attractions and public transportation. Our room was clean but a bit rundown. Don't count on the breakfast that is included; instant coffee and packaged muffins, etc. Better to go down the street to one of the local bagel shops or coffee shops.The lady at the front desk needs some sensitivity training. We observed her being just plain rude to some of the other guests.Overall, you get what you pay for. A low-cost place to sleep with no frills.
