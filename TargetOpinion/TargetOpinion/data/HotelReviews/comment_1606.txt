Not worth the ratrings

We had issues with the cleanliness of the room and helpfulness of the front desk. We had a package that included breakfast. We had to ask several times for our voucher for our second day, the first day voucher was delivered to our room shortly after we checked in. The bathrooms are really small. I mean really small. Beds are very comfortable however and the adjacent restaurant Lolas is very good.
