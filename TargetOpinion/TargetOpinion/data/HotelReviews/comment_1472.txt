Nothing Special!

I reserved an upgraded double room in the tower upper floors. Upon check-in I was informed I'd been given a single room. Since I was traveling with two children this wouldn't work! I was then given a double on a lower floor with somewhat of a view. The carpets were stained, the drapes pulled loose at the top and the bathroom door completely missing a handle. The beds were great though!The lobby is beautiful but the rooms are mediocre at best. They have a children's welcome gift upon check-in but were out of older kids bags so we were given the toddler gifts that consisted of electrical outlet plug covers, a night light and a rubber duck. Not much use to a 9 and 10 year old!The location is great and the cable car stops right in front!
