Prime location and excellent service

Our large executive room on the 23rd floor was ideal for the last few days of our visit to Australia.The hotel is located slap bang in the heart of Sydney's shopping area. We decided to use the rail link from the airport and were pleasantly surprised to note the hotel is only a five minute walk from St James station (n.b. there are steps to contend with from the station platform).We received a warm welcome from reception and our room not only had a great view but was also very well equipped. The bathroom had both a large tub and a large shower.The very large bed was comfortable and there was also a large desk. We were pleased with the attention to detail in the room.We made use of the Executive Club on the floor above. The staff here were very friendly and helpful. We took breakfast there rather than go down to the main restaurant. The selection was good and the atmosphere relaxed. We also had drinks and canapes there each evening.On one evening we had dinner in the restaurant. It was of a very good standard.The hotel is about a 15 minute walk from Circular Quay and The Rocks.Overall we were highly satisfied with this hotel and will certainly use it again when we next visit Sydney.
