Great little hotel, but snooty service

Renaissance Vendome is beautifully decorated, with very plush rooms: marble bathroom outfitted with Bulgari Green Tea toiletries; flat-screen TV, high thread count sheets. The location is lovely, too: just off the Place Vendome in the rue St Honore shopping district, and five minutes to metro Tuileries or walking distance to the Louvre if you're wearing flats. It's tucked away on a side street, so it's quiet and feels very intimate.The only downside is that the service doesn't feel very caring. I'm a Platinum member at the Marriott hotels, but received only a free breakfast: no cocktails, no internet access, no welcome drink. At breakfast, we were ignored by the staff until we literally had to peek into the kitchen to seek service. There was a false fire alarm at 10am on Sunday, and the staff didn't even bother to explain what was happening although guests were trooping down to the lobby in their bathrobes.Likewise, the concierge was not at his desk when I inquired about restaurant reservations. The receptionist literally said, It's not my job, before reluctantly helping me to call the restaurant. In the end, the concierge did return and did his job well, securing the booking and dialing my overseas mobile phone to confirm the booking with me; but it felt rather flat by that point.
