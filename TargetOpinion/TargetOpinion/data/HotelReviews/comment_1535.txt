Indenty Theft Alert

I usually stay at the Moore a couple times a year, without any problems.I always book in advance and pay with my credit card.Last time they asked for my drivers license.With Identity theft on the rise - I told them I didn't have a problem showing ID - but I wasn't going to let them write my Drivers License down.The Moore Hotel said that unless they wrote my drivers license down - I wouldn't be allowed to rent a room.I told them that the Hilton didn't require extra ID and My group went there instead.I reported them to Visa.
