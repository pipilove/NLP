Very Nice Hotel

After seeing this hotel during a tour on the cable car, we walked in to see if they had any rooms available for that night. They told us they were completely booked and if they had any rooms, they were $229 per night. We then went outside and used my husband's phone to call Hotels.com. They immediately booked us a room in this same hotel for only $119.00. It was a very nice hotel and a beautiful view of downtown San Francisco. It's not something I would do all the time but nice for one night.
