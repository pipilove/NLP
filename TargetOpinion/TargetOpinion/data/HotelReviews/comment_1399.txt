some disappointments

We'd heard a lot of good things about the Tuscan Inn from people who'd stayed there for a night or two before cruising out of the port of San Francisco. Normally we'd stay at the SF Hilton, or one of the Marriott properties, but we decided this time to try something else.The Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs  TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good. Street noise can be a problem in an outside room, though, and the window coverings (sliding Roman blinds that don't quite meet) left a lot to be desired if you don't want to get up with the sun.Housekeeping service was very inadequate, though. We left the room at 10:30 AM, placing the please make up room tag in the key slot. There were at least 4, and maybe 6, housekeeping carts between our room  the elevator. Yet when we returned at 3:30 the room hadn't been touched! The attached restaurant (Cafe Pescadore) is open for breakfast with a fairly skimpy menu - but quite good coffee.On balance, it was an OK place to stay but, perhaps, not to return to. It's fine if it's convenient to what you're doing in the city.
