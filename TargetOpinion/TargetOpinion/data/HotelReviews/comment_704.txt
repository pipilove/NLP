Worst hotel experience in recent memory

I had to attend Berlin at rather short notice to attend a large conferenece of lawyers: INTA. All the good hotels in town were completely booked out which left me the Alsterhof as my only option. I arrived about 10 am and was told my room wasn't ready. No apology from the staff just a statement that it would be ready at 1 maybe 2. Surly staff behind front desk but very nice fellow who acted as doorman during the day. No air-conditioning, characterless rooms althought they were clean. My mini bar was locked and it took 12 hours to get a key to it. Depressing and not to be recommended.
