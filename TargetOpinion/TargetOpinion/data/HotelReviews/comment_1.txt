Not what one expects

After much research, I finally decided on this hotel because of its position in Amsterdam and being classed asluxury seemed an ideal choice for my daughter and I to spend a weekend as her special birthday treat. I had warned her not to expect a very large room as the hotel is situated in the old canal houses along Prisengracht, what we did not expect was a small room in the attic which had a very noticeable odour.We tracked it down to the AC.The ceiling and upper walls showed obvious traces of damp along the tapes of the plasterboard,even a puddle shaped seepage onto the top of a pelmet over a (very) small window.Obviously the roof is leaking above this gable and the AC is blasting tainted air into the room.At Reception the Night-Duty Manager(female) whose name I have noted, appeared to resent being interrupted whilst in conversation with a friend, her expression when I told her what we thought was the cause; practically a sneer of disbelief.Her solution? To spray the room! This was not acceptable for health reasons.At no point did she seem interested,I could feel my professional face about to develop. Because I did not wish to spoil my daughter's first visit, I did not pursue the matter as vociferously as I would normally, or when with my husband. When we arrived back after an evening out, the curtain fabric had obviously been sprayed with a deodouriser!!Our own solution was to keep the AC off,which was only possible because the weather grew cooler.I do not expect this level of disinterest in ANY hotel.Also, the hotel would be advised to forget the waffles, chocolate and water freebies and provide tea and coffee making facilities. In conclusion, a disappointing choice when one compares this hotel with others experienced, of a supposed lesser category.The room had one window above head height, the other at desk height and faced a wall.
