Many plusses, but some problems

I actually loved this hotel for its spacious room, comfortable bathroom, close proximity to the Metro and a grocery (great for traveling with small kids) and fantastic location on a quiet street. However, continental breakfast (2 croissants and a hot drink) was overpriced at 9 euros (no discount for even little kids), and the elevator was out of order on 4 of the 6 days of our stay. When I suggested that there should be some accommodation for not having an elevator (as it was an essential part of my requirements when booking a room with small kids), I was told on the second (or third) day of our stay that they would find me another hotel, but that was all (i.e., take it or leave it). As I was traveling with two small children (ages 2  4), had already unpacked and had gotten acclimated, I didn't consider this a realistic option, especially for a 6-day stay. When I asked for a late check-out on our final day (2:30 pm, as opposed to noon), as a small concession, I was flatly and very curtly refused. Otherwise the service was very helpful. Finally, the cleaning staff was very, very good, but very, very noisy, talking loudly among themselves down the halls and up and down the stairs in the mornings. No problem if you're an early riser. In sum, many plusses, but I'm not sure it was worth the price.
