stayed 3 nights on 30 april 2004 -ok but not great

I have been to amsterdam 5 times previous but this is the first time I have stopped at the victoria. I wouldnt say I would not stop here again but it would definitely not be my top choice. I booked the victoria because the hotel I usually stop in was full booked in fact most good hotels were booked due to queens day. The public places in the hotel are nice but the rooms are absolutely not of a 4 star standard they are dated but they are what I would call just OK. Please be aware though there was no indication that breakfast was not included and at the end of my stay I was presented with a 120 euro bill for 2 people having breakfast for 3 mornings. When we went in for breakfast we were not told that it would be 20 euros each and at check-in nothing was mentioned about extra charges for breakfast. Overall hotel OK but they are much better three star ones for less money with central location.
