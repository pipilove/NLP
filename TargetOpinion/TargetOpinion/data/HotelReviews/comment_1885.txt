Loved it!

This hotel was just fantastic. My partner and I booked it for the night he returned from a month long trip home to Saudi Arabia. It was such a wonderful hotel - the room was beautiful and the view was fantastic. I had some initial doubts about the view (it's not on the side of the Novotel, Ibis, etc, where the best views are) but it was still beautiful. The room was extremely comfortable and the service was great - we ordered a club sandwhich for a late breakfast and it arrived within 15 minutes.It is the best hotel I've stayed at in Sydney, hands down.
