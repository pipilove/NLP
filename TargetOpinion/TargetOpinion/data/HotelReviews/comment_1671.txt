Entirely Too Trendy

My wife and I recently stayed at the W Seattle and enjoyed our stay, but there are a few things that prevented me from rating the hotel higher than average. First off, there wasn't a coffee maker in the room. I know it is Seattle and there is a Starbucks on every corner, but this is something that every hotel that I have ever stayed in has. Secondly, this place will nickel and dime you to death. For example: $35 a night for parking and $14 for a small ham and cheese sandwich in the restaurant.I also did not like it when we walked into the hotel on Saturday night and found that the lobby had been turned into the most popular nightclub in Seattle. There was literally a D.J. spinning dance music records very loud in the lobby. All of the beautiful people were there and I was not impressed. If you are snobby, wealthy, or a self centered person this is the hotel for you. It is very dark and the decorations in the common areas are very artsy fartsy. The only reason my wife and I stayed here, was that it was during Sea Fair, and I found a great rate on the W's website. The hotel is located in a fantastic location. We won't be returning.
