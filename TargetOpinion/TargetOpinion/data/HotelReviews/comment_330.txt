5 star, I don't think so!!

My Husband  I decided to extend our cruise by staying for two nights at the Majestic. We booked the Majestic because of the fabulous photos on its website, however in hindsight should have checked Tripadvisor reviews first!!!We booked a 'superior' room as it was our wedding anniversary however were given a really shabby standard room. I can say that this was possibly the worst hotel room I have ever stayed in!! The room was small very dark and really grubby - especially the walls which could do with a good lick of paint and carpets replaced. Its only redeeming factor was the bathroom which was small but clean.On arrival the exterior  lobby are very impressive, however thats about all this hotel has to offer. My advice, stay in a nice 3 star hotel, 5 stars this hotel is'nt.
