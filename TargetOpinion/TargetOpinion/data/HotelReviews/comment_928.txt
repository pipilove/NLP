We had a fantastic stay.

The hotel is very modern and immaculately clean. We had a small balcony and the room was immaculate with the most white and crisp bedding. The bathroom was very modern and trendy with lovely fluffy white towels.The staff were all very pleasant and helpful without exception.A verg good buffet breakfast was provided each morning.We will stay at this hotel when we return to Paris.Highly recommended for a quiet, relaxing holiday.Surely a FIRST CLASS HOTEL
