beware of thief in your room

Just returned from a two night stay at this hotel. Stayed with two friends. When we arrived we enquired if we could have two keys to the room, as we would be returning at different times. I was concerned because our room could be left unlocked. The hotel staff advised that there would be no problem as the front door was not left unattended. So much for this, during the night someone entered the room( more worrying because my friends were in bed) and stole a number of items, mobile phone, PDA etc. This really destroyed a great visit to the city. So my advice if there are more than one of you and you need to arrange different return times, this is not the hotel for you
