Not the best of Westin

We stayed here four nights, including Christmas. The lobby and location of the hotel are fantastic. You are right in Union Square and just blocks from MUNI and the F Cars. Our room was in the newer tower on the 18th floor. It was an average room, not too large. The bed was the usual Heavenly bed and very comfortable, but outside of that, a rather average room. The parking was $44 a day, but compared to surrounding garages, that was actually the cheapest! We didn't eat in any of the restaurants, but Sears' Fine Dining and Lefty O'Douls just outside of the hotel both had good breakfasts. Overall, not the usual Westin experience I've had in the past, especially as a Starwood member.
