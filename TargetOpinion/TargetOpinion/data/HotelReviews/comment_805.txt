Acceptable Economy Hotel, Not for Everyone

We stayed here for 5 nights while my husband attended a conference, but we would not stay here again.Good Bits: Very reasonable price, convenient location (almost next to U-Bahn Stop), safe neighborhood, acceptable food, adequate serviceBad Bits: The beds are not intended for 2 people, much too small. Plus, we are both tall people (about 6 feet tall) and our feet hung off the end. The bed was very lumpy and uncomfortable. Plus, the sheets  duvet are 100% polyester. Extremely scratchy and way too warm. It is also near a hospital and there were sirens all night long.If you are someone inclined towards sleep issues, DO NOT STAY HERE! I got next to no sleep on this trip and spent my days wandering about in a daze from sleep deprivation.Meanwhile, my husband slept like a log and lost no sleep whatsoever. I spent my nights wishing desperately for sleep and suppressing an overwhelming desire to poke him for being able to sleep so well!
