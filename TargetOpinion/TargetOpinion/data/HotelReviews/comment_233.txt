Nadia Never Again, Not Even for Free

I stayed her for 3 nights and apart from a central location and a cheap price I ended up with scabies for months.Beware as it seems to me it is infested by bugs. Also apart from having a fridge and tv the bathroom was basically a shower with a toilet in it.The manager seemed extremly rude, unfriendly and I would not recomend staying there unless you want to suffer!!!!!!!!
