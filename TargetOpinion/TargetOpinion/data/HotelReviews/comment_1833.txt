Great Hotel - Cold Food

This is a great hotel with very clean and nicely appointed rooms with lovely views of the harbour. Staff were generally very friendly and we had no real problems except we felt the food was ordinary. We ordered hot food from the bar menu after coming back after a show and not only was there a long wait, it was basically cold when we got it. Cocktails were small and overpriced for what you got. The food in the buffet breakfast was cold also. I selected my food from the buffet and went straight back to my table and it was hardly warm and certainly cold by the time I was about half way through. Great location and place to stay but be careful of the food. We didn't have an evening meal in the restaurant though so I can't comment on that. They need to watch those food temperatures though or someone is going to end up with some serious food poisoning.
