One night at the Chancellor

Stayed in the Chancellor for a stopover night.Wanted to get some quick shopping in and figured where better to stay than the heart of the city?Close to everything, Union Square views, cable cars outside the door, 5 minutes walk to Market Street. Excellent location.The rooms are clean and well presented and while not huge are more than adequate for a couple.We got moved from the second floor to the 4th floor because of the hum of the air-con units outside the window. Wouldn't have bothered me, but my light-sleeping missus wasn't having any of it. A quick call to Reception and we were shown 3 other rooms to take a choice from! Room 406 is beside the fire escape to the rear and was pretty quiet -my missus was well happy!Result.
