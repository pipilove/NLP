Not impressive.

My husband was attending a conference at the hotel and we chose to stay directly at the hotel for the latter part of the conference. The first few days we spent at the Alexis which was absolutely gorgeous. Even though we booked directly through the Sheraton's website, they were unable to accommodate us with a room in the newly refurbished section of the hotel unless we chose a room with only double beds. Although the room was good sized, it was very drab. The bathroom was cramped compared to what the Alexis offered, and the toiletries provided were way too perfumey. What can I say, a simple pleasure of mine is to enjoy the lotions, etc. that the hotel provides. On a positive note, the bed was very comfortable and the heater noise was minimal. The front desk staff was also very nice.They nickel and dime you though. $12/day including tax for internet? Give me a break. I was spoiled by the room and amenities at the Alexis, and that's the only place I'll stay next time.
