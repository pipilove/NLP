great location, incredible views

Hilton - stay on executive floor (great lounge) get a room overlooking the Gendarmenmarkt (beautiful day and night). They also have a nice pool and spa but the children at all hours in the pool will drive you to the nudist spa area, which is pretty nice and child free. There are several good restaurants near by.We loved the eastern sector location with it's delightful walking areas and proximity to museum island and gorgeous neo-classical architecture. The Potsdammer Platz is very times square with it's glass and steel highrises and heavy traffic.The rooms are very comfortable - typical Hilton decor - nice sheets and good showers.The concierge was very helpful with local restaurants.The lounge had a great breakfast and offered drinks through the day including wine, etc. at evenings with appetizers.
