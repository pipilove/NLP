Best Vacation Ever!!!!

My fiance and I were in Europe for a conference and decided to stay in Paris for a week of vacation following the conference. We had accumulated Hilton honors points and the hilton representative recommended we use our points here. SHE WAS RIGHT!!!! I wish I could thank her!The Hilton Arc de Triomphe is fabulous. I came in early, 7 am. Check in was not until later in the afternoon. They immediately took my bags and let me into their lounge which had a full breakfast buffet, magazines, and television. They told me to make myself comfortable and gave me a key card for a restroom down the hall should I need it. I was given my room in two hours. They were extraordinarily nice. The room was impeccably clean. We stayed for 7 days. They gave us access to the lounge, which included free breakfast, snacks and cocktails. We also had access to the gym. The spa was also included, it has a really great jacuzzi tub. The room was cleaned several times a day. The bathtub was sparkling! We got bathrobes and slippers to use while in the hotel. All of these amenities are included in the price. The bed was amazingly comfortable. The hotel is located in a very clean and safe area. Not to mention, very quiet. It is also very close to the metro and several shops and restaurants are within a 10 minute walk. The attention to detail and customer service at this hotel is SO WORTH IT!!!!!For a romantic parisian getaway... this is the place to be!
