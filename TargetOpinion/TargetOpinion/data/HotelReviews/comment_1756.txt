Great Location + Lots of Perks

My daughter is interested in attending the University of Washington, so she and I visited Seattle in April and stayed at the Watertown. It's only a few blocks from the UW campus - easy walking distance.The hotel had many amenities that appealed to us and made it our choice over the cheaper hotels available in the campus area:- Bikes and helmets are available free of charge. We took a nice ride along the nearby Burke-Gilman Trail. However, their bikes were not in the best condition. They told me some were in the shop, and those that were left were barely adequate. If you're a serious biker, I'd call ahead and make sure there are some good ones available.- Free carts of various entertainments were available. It turned out we didn't use any, but I can see how they'd be great for families with young kids in particular.- Free high-speed Internet.- Free shuttle to the downtown (and back).- Free breakfast, which isn't at Embassy Suites quality, but does include scrambled eggs, cereal, and scones. And there are chocolate chip cookies in the lobby.Rooms are nicely sized and attractive. Also lots of cable channels available. The Starbucks coffee and candies were a nice touch too.There is also a reasonably priced shuttle (Town Car!) service to and from the airport, so we didn't have to rent a car or pay for parking. Info is on their web site.Overall, I'd say it's a very good value for the Seattle area, and I'd recommend the hotel to anyone.
