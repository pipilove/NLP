Pretty Poor Apartment

I Stayed in Apartment 7305, 1 bedroom with lounge, kitchen, bathroom and laundry plus a small entry.I would rate the apartment 1 star and very hard to find any comfort in this apartment.On Arrival to the hotel I had booked and pre paid for a standard single room, I asked how much to upgrade to an apartment and they said it would be free, that was great.I knew that the stair case was going to be steep so the porter led me to the back of the hotel, down an alley and up the stair case which was like a ladder on a slight angle.The apartment on first view seemed large and I wanted privacy and got it too.I firstly un packed and put on some music but found out the stereo speakers had blown so had to turn it off. The apartment had lots of bits and pieces all arranged in a disorganised way so after a few hours I arranged it to the way I thought would be comfortable.The bedroom had 2 small single beds which are light and cheaply made they did not feel comfortable and I did not use them, the lounge had a pull out sofa bed similer to a futon and I used this bed but it was very hard to put together and everynight fell apart so I never had a good sleep.The kitchen had sufficient cutlery, crockery and cookware to cook basic foods and I cooked each night (suparmarket food in Amsterdam is incredibly cheap and I spend a total of 84 euros for 3 meals a day for 7 days). The fridge is very small so don't buy too much, the oven and hot plates worked well, microwave was fine and good lighting.The lounge has a TV, bookshelf, sofa bed, very large dinner table which takes up most of the space in the lounge, 2 chairs and 2 lounge chairs plus coffee table. It all looks like what you would see in an apartment of young guys who have just moved out of their parents house and have collected bits and pieces and hand me downs, nothing very comfortable or pleasant on the eye.The lounge also has a video player but my one did not work and no one could fix it, they also supply a file with the leaflets of all the appliances in the apartment but as so many of the appliances have been replaced over time the leaflets had not been replaced and are for appliances no longer in the apartment.The cupboard laundry has a washing machine and as savvy as I am with these kinds of appliances and with full instructions I struggled to use it as it i not your normal automatic front loader.After 3 nights in the apartment I started to get ill so I thought I need to give this place a good clean, I pulled the sofa away from the wall in the lounge only to find heaps of rotting food scraps and this is when I realised the apartment was dirty, I stayed ill for most of my time at the hotel.What did work superbly was the mini in room safe.The area around the hotel is awful, I saw so many drug addicts taking hard drugs in every corner of the hotels ally and area that connects the Royal Wing to the Main Hotel, every time I left my apartment to go out I was met with endless amounts of people asking me to buy drugs or promising me to help me find my way or offering info on Amsterdam, I was cleverly taken in by a few of these people as they seem so trustful only to find I was duped and again these are the people that are the drug users. If you are not use to this kind of environment you would just think they are friendly locals helping a tourist.I had breakfast in the hotel and it does cost 25euros but its really good, top quality foods well prepared. I enjoyed having a glass of bubbly in the morning before breakfast.The area that the hotel is located is the Red Light area and its very sleazy, loaded with drug addicts, husslers and all sorts of people hanging around the streets looking to make a quick buck.I spent the balance of my time in Leidersplane and found that the Park Hotel and the Marriot are well located in a more conservative healthy part of town.The stair case to the apartment always smelt of vomit and the apartment comes either cold or hot no in between.I hope my review will help you make an informed decision, I paid Euros 120 per night for this experience.Thank you
