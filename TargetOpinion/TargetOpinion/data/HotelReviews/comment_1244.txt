Good value

We paid $109 for our twin room. The room was small but adequate but the ceiling fan was not enought to cool the room. We kept the curtains closed for most of the day but it was still hot at night. The bathroom is very small but the location made up for any downfalls. The cable car is on the doorstep and Union Square is a two minute walk away. The constant supply of coffee, cookies and superb fresh apples helped the budget. The staff were helpful and courteous with a lobby shop that sells transport tickets. The hotel is very near diners and all that San Francisco has to offer. A tip, ask for a quiet room at the rear of the hotel, no view but a peaceful sleep.
