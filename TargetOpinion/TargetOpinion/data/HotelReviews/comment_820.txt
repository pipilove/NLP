Funky Hotel

This is a lovely hotel in the Mitte area of Berlin. Very close to several U Bann Stations. Rooms were clean, good sized and well decorated with modern decor. There is a Flat Screen TV with DVD player - so be sure to bring some CD's if you are staying - we forgot! Rooms were quiet given the busy street outside,The only thing that could have been included was breakfast - which there was a charge of 12 Euro per person for. If you walk outside the hotel there are plenty of eating placed closeby. The Indian place directly across the road was really nice for dinner and drinks - There are also a few italian's nearby.All in all a really nice 4 star hotel
