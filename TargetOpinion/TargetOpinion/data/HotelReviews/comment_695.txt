Terrible Hotel

The service at the Alexandra Hotel was rude and slow especially on reception. When I sat in the cocktail lounge for a drink, I had to wait for ages to be served (along with several other tables). The staff tend to be young and inexperienced. The single room I had was very small with a sloping roof and despite only having a small single bed, there wasn't even room for for a desk. None of the special touches I am used to a hotel of this rating (I had to ask for toiletries because I had forgotton my shampoo but this is something I normally don't need to concern myself with in a 4 star hotel). No clock radio was provided which meant you had to rely on the facilities provided with the TV but all the instructions for the audio/video equipment are in German and no-one gave me the wakeup call I asked for. The hotel is understaffed and staff's knowledge of English isn't good. All in all a very big disappointment!
