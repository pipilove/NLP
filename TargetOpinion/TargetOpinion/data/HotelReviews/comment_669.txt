Second visit

Stayed in this hotel over New Year for the past 2 years. 2004  2005.Ideally located and a comfortable hotel. Yes, breakfast is a little busy, but come on folks, be patient! What do some people want! The food was great and always plentiful and was replenished regualrly. The rooms had modern decor and were far more than adequate. We got great deals on both occasions, and could not complain for the price.It is ideally placed to tour Berlin from. The tour bus goes from the end of the street and is close to Zoo Station.The nearby restaurants were excellent, the one almost opposite -called the Meineke I believe, was good, but we also enjoyed the small restaurant, which you would probably mistake for a bar on the same side as the hotel at the top of the street as you head towards the Ku'Damn.Berlin is a top city and highly recommended for New Year!Try out a trabi safari - it is great fun - especially in 3ft of snow in a car with no heating......................or brakes come to think of it!!
