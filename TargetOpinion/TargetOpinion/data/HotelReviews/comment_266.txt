Great hotel, fantastic location

We stayed in this hotel from 22nd - 24th June and to be honest i dont think we could have chosen a better place. Not just because of the rooms but also because of the location. To be honest when you are away you only spend a few hours in teh hotel and to sleep there. The hotel is located right next to dam square on the main road (DAMRAK) to the centraal station. It is about a 10 minute walk (with luggage) from the station.To get to the station from teh airport is 7.60 euos (from a machine) or 8.60 from the counter and takes about 15/20 mins. So from the airport you can be in your hotel room in about 30 mins with no hassles at all.The hotel itself was clean and new and had everything that you would want from a stay there. We had a king sized bed, TV with uk channels and satelite channels, coffee machine and a nice bathroom. Our bedroom was on the side of the hotel (not facing the main road) however there was good double glazed windows and we didnt get any noise at all. If you had a road facing room you may get noise but couldnt say for sure.We didnt get breakfast included and for 20 euros there are cheaper places around.All in all a great place to stay and the location couldnt be better.
