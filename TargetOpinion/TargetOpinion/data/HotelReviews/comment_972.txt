Great view

Really nice room. It was small but it didn't feel like your average hotel room, because the furniture and decoration was classy and unusual.Good location, a couple of minutes' walk from the Metro and a stroll from many of Paris's best-known sights. Terrific view of the Pantheon from our room.Facilities fine.Only sour note: I phoned reception the day before we arrived to order flowers for my girlfriend's birthday. They were really helpful and the roses duly arrived outside our room in the morning.However, the effect was rather ruined as we were checking out, when the morning receptionist told me, loudly and in front of my girlfriend, that there was a problem with the bill as we still owed 36 Euros for the flowers. er, thanks.And the lift is recommended only to the intrepid.
