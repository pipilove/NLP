Disappointed

We came to Holland to pick up a puppy. We got written approval before hand to have our puppy stay at the hotel, but once we arrived they told us dog were not allowed. Also, we arrived early and after a ten hour flight they wouldn't let us have a room even if we paid extra, so we stayed in the waiting area for five hours before anyone would alow us our room and get some sleep. So our trip started off right away on the wrong foot. The room was small and had no AC, on top of that the day time temp. was running 90 degrees. The only place we had to get cool was in the resturant or waiting area. The food was good and the hotel was fairly clean, but once our first three days were up we went to get our pup and never came back. The little hotel in the country had much better food, service and much larger room for a lot less money. The new hotel was dog friendly and we could even take our pup into their fancy French resturant. There were a lot of people there with dogs and made our stay so much more enjoyable!Watch out for pick pockets around this area!!!
