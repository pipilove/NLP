Surprises

A surprise 5 day anniversary trip to the Ritz Carlton Berlin was absolutely fantastic. Our room was turn -right-out-of-the-lift-and-count-23-chandeliers... We were on the club floor, fabulous and ideal for the family gathering. Enthusiastic and genuinely friendly staff made it feel very special. The highlight was our exquisite meal in the Vitrum and the piece de resistence? Lowered lights, the music from our wedding, a very special cake decorated with candles, and suspended on choclate tapers a breath taking diamond ring(that bit costs extra). Worth it,oh yes.I'd recommend this hotel unreservedly.
