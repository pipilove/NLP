Good, clean

Stayed 6 nights last week.....great location, clean. Of course, small room and bathroom (room #18) . The shower is sooo tiny! Grabbed pastry from a bakery one block away and coffee every AM and was cheaper than eating breakfast there. Train station is right there too. Not the Ritz, but neither is the price! Bernard was very helpful too.
