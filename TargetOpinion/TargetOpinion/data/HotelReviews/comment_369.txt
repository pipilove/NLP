Elevator nightmare

It is a wonderful hotel, with wonderful service, all the amenities, etc. However, the elevators are so slow, that I think 20% of my time in the hotel was spent waiting for them, trying to get my room key to work to make it go to the club floor, etc. It was ridiculous -- and everyone in the hotel was complaining about it. Make no mistake, this hotel is of the highest class, especially the club lounge, which is terrific, but I began to dread leaving my room for the elevators, because they were that bad.
