Hotel Royal disappointment

My Husband and I booked a three night stay in Apr 07 at the 4 star (?) Hotel Royal on Las Ramlas. It worked out cheapest to book directly with the hotel via the website however we feel, after staying, that the hotel is over-priced and over-rated. In our opinionit should only just scrape a 3 star rating. The hotel is bland and unwelcoming although the reception and housekeeping staff were friendly. There are absolutely no facilities within the hotel so you really are just paying for a room. The tv was old and could only pickup one English speaking channel - CNN. We appreciate that you don't go away on a city break to watch tv but it's nice to have the option as it is a facility advertised and one which you are paying for afterall. If you like to iron your clothes before an evening out, take a travel iron as the hotel does not have one you can use. Also take a travel kettle as the rooms do not have tea/coffee making facilities.The adjoining 'restaurant' was expensive and the menu limited and unimaginative especially for vegans/vegetarians. The pizzas look better than they taste and the complimementary olives tasted stale. The salad consisted of a handful of mixed leaves and half a tomato! Overall, we would not recommend this hotel and will not be returning to Barcelona. Apart from some nice architecture, the city is dirty, overcrowded and really you could be in any other city in Europe... plenty of Starbucks, Mc Donald's and Burger King's if that's your thing. We were particularly upset to see caged birds of all varietiesfor sale along Las Ramblas and the pet shops were also archaic selling puppies on show in glass fronted cages. If you are still tempted to visit, stay in a hotel off the Las Ramblas as I think you will get a much better deal. Transport around the city is good so getting about is easy. Use the Aerobus to and from the airport - cheaper and less hassle that the Metro.
