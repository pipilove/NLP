A disappointing experience

I booked a city break through Brendan Vacations and was placed at the Park Inn. I was very disappointed in the area as of November 2005. The building was surrounded on three sides by construction and graffitti were plentiful. Some of the buildings across the street from the hotel looked like housing projects. The area is one of urban blight. Even a city guide book concedes that the square in in redevelopment. At present, this poorly lit area isn't safe for a single woman. There were few places to go in the evening. The money spent on taxis could have purchased a room at the beautiful Radisson SAS, which is down the street but out of the Park Place square. Brendan was of no help in offering candid information on the area or in arranging for an alternative location. I would not recommend this hotel. The lobby is full of smoke. Moreover, there was only one computer in the business center, which I had to clean with wet wipes myself. The television featured promotions of pornography, which I had no interest in seeing.
