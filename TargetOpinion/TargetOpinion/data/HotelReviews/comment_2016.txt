Excellent hotel in convenient location

We enjoyed five nights at the Sydney Travelodge on Wentworth Avenue. The location is excellent being within easy walking distance of the CBD through Hyde Park, Darling Harbour, Oxford Street restaurants and Museum Railway Station is three minutes walk away where one can catch a train to Circular Quay.We were given a room on the top floor (18th) and enjoyed interesting views of the city and beyond. The room was very quiet, in fact we heard no noise at all from the street or adjoining rooms. The room was simple but very comfortable and clean. The provision of microwave, crockery and cutlery is excellent for those on a budget and we found a Coles Supermarket eight minutes walk away where we purchased food. There are a number of smaller more expensive convenience stores closer to the Hotel.Our room was serviced each day and we enjoyed coming back to our room each evening after a busy day sightseeing and finding fresh towels etc.Overall, we found the Sydney Travelodge to be good value for money. It is a good, basic, no frills Hotel.
