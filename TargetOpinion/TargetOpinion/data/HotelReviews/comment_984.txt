Good location

This hotel is in a wonderful location as detailed in previous reviews. It is a small hotel with small rooms and bathrooms and an extremely small lift - be warned! This lift held two reasonably slim people with small weekend bags - I can't imagine what it would be like for two large people with full sized suitcases, I think probably you would have to go in shifts. Also might be a problem with someone with a lift phobia or claustrophobia. Thankfully we didn't have that. The rooms were small, clean and the refurbished bathrooms were lovely but again very small. Your early morning wake-up call is the local church whose bells starting ringing at around 7.00 a.m. The breakfast room was nicely decorated but the breakfast was definitely not worth 10 Euros as evidenced by the relatively few people who were eating there on our first morning. The other two mornings we spent around the corner in the bakery which was really good. The staff were very pleasant and helpful and we really enjoyed our stay. However, I have stayed in 3* hotels in Paris on three other occasions and this hotel did not quite match up to the standard of the others.
