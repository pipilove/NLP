Once was enough.

We made our decision to stay here after seeing their website. Totally misleading. This hotel is a 3 star, not a 4 star. Hotel reception not very friendly. Some staff members were friendly, but it wasn't their regular attitude.  At 2 am, a group of drunk guests started singing along to Karaoke really loudly. We called the reception 3 times to complain. They kept saying 'We will see to it, sir' every time, but nothing really happened. It really ruins the good vibe you picked up from touring beautiful places during the day.Shower room is incredibly tiny. They have fit in the modern features of jet shower, but not practical since there is no room to really move about. Not a very good location if you want to tour around the centre of Paris by metro. Our trip back to hotel after a romantic dinner or beautiful tour around Paris wasn't pleasant. Metro full of drunk people. Probably because you have to use the metro right in the middle of red district. The hotel is right next to the cemetery as well. I wasn't aware of this until we checked in. Next time, we will book a hotel in saint Germaine area.
