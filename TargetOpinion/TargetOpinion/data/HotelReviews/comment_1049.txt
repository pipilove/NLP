Hassle-free

We spent a lot of time looking for hotels and as we'd left it until the last minute found most places were booked. In desperation we rang around a number of hotels and found the reception staff at the Residence Henri IV extremely friendly and helpful. We were concerend that the rooms in Paris - and the beds - might be small so they fitted us with two twins (basically a double bed with two mattresses) which were perfect. The check in and check out were completely hassle-free - took literally two minutes; and no complications. While the rooms might be a little tired they have character and importantly are clean, airy and a very good size, not just for Paris standars but for anywhere. The bathroom was similarly spacious and unlike most hotels actually had a window. We were extremely pleased with the location of the hotel and the service we received there and would have no hesitation in recommending it to others. We didn't try the breakfast as there were basic kitchen facilities in the room and plenty of cafes nearby.
