Main plus point is it's location

Location was great but the rooms although a fair size were too hot and stuffy and you cannot control the temperature.Advertised complimentary tea and coffee was no longer complimentary on arrival.Breakfast was acceptable.Not a hotel for people who want to come back and relax with a drink etc
