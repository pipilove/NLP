Undecided

I'm undecided about this hotel. We like Amsterdam but the hotel we usually stay at was full; so we opted for the Victoria. We booked and stayed for 1 night (2nd Feb).There was a lot about the Victoria I liked. I found the staff good, and the location is excellent. We had a executive room on the 3rd floor and the room was clean, tidy and comfortable. We ate lunch in Vic's (the on site restaurant), and the food was great.On the downside the lobby/communal area on the ground floor is long and quite narrow. This means that for us/you non smokers it is quite common to run a gauntlet of smoke betwen the lifts and the outside world. I found this quite unpleasant. Also I had one of my worst night's sleep in this hotel due to several other guests on my floor being noisy until about 4am.So next time I visit Amsterdam I'm going to book my usual hotel far enough ahead!
