Beware before you book

Everyone beware of this hotel before you book. I was planning a month trip to Europe including berlin, which I was very excited. I had gotten my dates confused and booked a week earlier by mistake being six months in advance. I noticed and called the hotel to just simply change the day I was checking in. They were so rude and refused to change my dates for which i was charged in full already, nor would they issue a refund to me, which I am very upset, and after this, I wouldnt stay there if it were free, and the rooms look very dull and plane by looking at other peoples pictures. I just cant beleve that any place would do this to a paying customer. If their customer service is this bad, I can just imagine having a problem with the room and what they would do to solve it nothing probally.
