Sydney ant our feet

We (18 year old daughter, partner and I) stayed at the Altamont Hotel, Sydney, for a week this July (2007).This was our first trip to Australia and our first port of call in the country, so impressions were important.I would recommend the Altamont to the independent traveller. All staf were friendly, welcoming and helpful. The hotel was comfortable and spotlessly clean and I really liked its individual style in terms of decor and furnishing.It's well placed within easy walking distance of every main attraction that Sydney has to offer, and from several different directions, following a variety of routes into town, maximizing exploring potential. We took full advantage of this, visiting galleries, museums, bookshops, the Aquarium, Opera House, taking shopping and boating trips.The hotel is located near to grocery stores, a laundry, and more international restaurants than I have seen anywhere else on my travels.I would certainly stay at the hotel again because of its comfort, friendliness of staff, location and value for money. My one suggestion for improvement would be that breakfast could be more imaginative and varied.
