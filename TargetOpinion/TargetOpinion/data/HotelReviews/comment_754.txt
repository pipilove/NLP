Decent hotel

Nothing too exciting about this hotel, but nothing bad as well. Location is fairly good for tourists - Nearest metro and the main shopping high street is just 5 mins walk away. To get to most of the attractions though you have to go to Mitte area but for a good price (under E100), this is a nice place. (We really enjoyed walking on the main street and actually would prefer to stay here than Mitte - the cafe scene is really nice). Negatives - We got to hotel at 11am but they would not let us check in before 2pm. We had requested a crib for our baby but we got a rollaway bed. Our room was on the main street so we did hear a bit of traffic noise but it didnt really affect our sleep. We didnt have the breakfast as it seemed too expensive and there are so many cafes nearby that one can go to that it didnt seem worth it. Overall the hotel staff was very accomodating and helpful and I would recommend this hotel to people who want to stay in a good standard hotel at a budgeted price.
