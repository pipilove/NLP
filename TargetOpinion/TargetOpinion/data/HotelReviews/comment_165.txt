what is that smell

Just back from 5 days in amsterdam. We stayed in the Victoria hotel. On arrival we booked in too early but the pleasant staff at the desk got the porters to store our bags so we could go site seeing as our room wasn't ready. Our room was clean but small but we were happy until the first morning when the stench from the bathroom was sickening. This was the same each morning. It smelt like raw sewage. YUCK YUCK YUCK!!!!!!!!
