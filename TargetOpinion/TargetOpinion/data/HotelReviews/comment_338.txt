A hotel that needs more attention to detail.

This is a man's hotel, and not women friendly. The city's most expensive restaurant reeks of cigars, and the rooms need to be aired out. Small details like bathrobes that are soft and comfortable, kleenex in the room, plugs for laptops in the desks, alarm clocks, doors that do not slam shut with incredible noise, and sound-proofing would be useful. As well, the water supply of the city of Barcelona requires visitors to have spring water, this was not provided or even easily available. Heating and air-conditioning are very uneven and cannot be controlled.The pool on the roof is laughable - it is exactly 12 feet by six feet and unheated. They should simply put whirlpool jets in it and accept the fact that it is nothing more than a big bathtub. The roof also is unsafe for children as it has no safety rails and a very large drop down. While the staff of this hotel are very nice, the lack of attention to detail means this is no more than a businessman's hotel for very short stays, and the fact that at least half the rooms have a terrible view of a concrete carpark is another consideration. Breakfast is not included, is eaten in the basement and is 26 Euros. There are no no-smoking areas in the hotel.
