Beware - this hotel overbooks - you may not get your room!

We made our booking for 2 rooms for 4 elderly pensioners (one 83 years old) arriving in the middle of the night through HotelTravel.com. It was CONFIRMED in May for 2 nights in September and FULLY PAID by credit card. Imagine our horror to arrive at 3.00am (having notified our late arrival at the time of booking) to find NO ROOMS available. The hotel staff didn't seem at all concerned saying they overbook all the time. They said as there was an exhibition on we would be lucky to get 2 rooms together but would try. At first they tried to seperate our party of 4 and put us in a hotel just for one night. Only after we made a fuss did we manage to get a hotel for the 2 nights together. To add insult to injury a Spanish customer arrived after us and checked in normally and given a room! We didn't get to our rooms at the other hotel until 6.00am and we were on the opposite side of Barcelona away from other members of our group. We spent most of the next day in bed recovering from the ordeal and the 2 day break was ruined.HotelTravel.com has told us the hotel refuses to take any action or responsibilty and they can only offer credit points of 40 euros off our next booking with them. We are disgusted with both HotelTravel.com  the Torre Catalunya Hotel.
