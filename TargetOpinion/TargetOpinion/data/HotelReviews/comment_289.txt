Loved the Fita Hotel

Fita is a nice, small hotel in a great location. It is near the Rembrandt museum and Rijksmuseum, near tram and bus stops, and in a residential area so visitors may get a glimpse of how Amsterdam residents live, commute to work on bicycles and bring their children to school. Entrance to the hotel is restricted, which makes one feel safe. The room was lovely. I had a balcony overlooking a school playground. The bathroom was large, with a shower and bathtub (and rubber duck!) You can buy tickets to the Rembrandt Museum and Rijksmuseum through the hotel. The breakfast was good. The breakfast room was set up so that visitors could easily converse and make acquaintances. It was a lovely place, a great location. I would stay there again!
