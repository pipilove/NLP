Nice Decor Nice Staff Good Location

The 1898 Hotel is in a good location, the decor is very pleasant and the atmosphere quiet and peaceful. However our stay was marred by the rooms being too hot. Strangely, rooms have lots of flashy controls for individualising sound and lighting but have none for temperature and have no air conditioning unit. We were sweating buckets and this is in March! So goodness help anyone staying there in August! We had no option but to open our windows which then brought in lots of noise.Our other bug bear was that this is one of those hotels which seems to think that twin beds pushed together somehow constitutes a double room. Very disappointing for a romantic break!
