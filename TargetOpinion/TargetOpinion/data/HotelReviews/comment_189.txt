Great stay at Banks Mansion

I recently spent four days at Banks Mansion during a long weekend. We both loved it and would recommend it to friends. The location is great as it is equidistant between the centre of town and the museum area- we walked pretty much everywhere all weekend but the tram was outside the door if you wanted it. Also it is on one of the main canals, but it is far enough away from the neon lights and really touristy squares to feel really relaxed (although there is a sqaure with all this only a block away if you want it). Room was nicely done with massive walk-in shower and art deco styling. We didnt have a canal view as all were booked but it was fine and heavy curtains and double glazing kept out all noise from the street. Really nice touch is free mini bar in room and free serve yourself area downstairs- soft drinks, wine, beers, coffee, tea, cava and even spirits. Also free internet. Dont get me wrong, you dont go to Amsterdam to drink all day in the room, but it was really nice to go back to freshen up and have a beer before heading out, or a night cap when returning home. We normally dont use hotel facilities as it always feels a rip-off, but it made it feel really relaxing to be able to do this.
