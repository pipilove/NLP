When inexpensive means tacky

If you can climb the streets of San Francisco and then spend the evening with no way to even heat water for tea, much less have coffee, then be the Chancellor's guest. I requested a microwave, and the dead-pan answer was that they had coffee and hot water 24 hours a day in the lobby. Not good. And the notes from others about no climate control should be taken seriously. Chancellor will respond that the windows can be opened. My window jammed when I locked it to get some safety from the antiquated fire escape, and I called immediately for someone to come and free the lock. When I check out the next morning, the lock was still jammed. Staff attitudes are questionable: chambermaids friendly enough. Desk staff, bartender, appear as if trained to avoid eye contact, and not even return smiles, much less originate them.
