Very dissapointing

I stayed here whilst on business in Sydney, as my company has an agreement with the Swissotel. On arrival, I was asked for a credit card, even though my stay was to be fully charged back to my companys AMEX. I informed the front desk of this, at which time they told me I couldn't stay there, unless I gave them a $150 deposit, even though they had the security of a company credit card. This happend to my two co-workers also. In the end, they ended up asking to hold either a cell phone or a drivers licence as security. I was completely disgusted, as this happend at about 11pm at night. I handed over my drivers licence, and a member of staff from the front desk informed me that unless I gave them a credit card in the morning all services would be cut off to me. I had a message left on my phone to contact reception at my earliest convienience the next morning, so I did so before breakfast. I told them that they should call my company, and they would confirm that there was a full charge back to the company credit card. That night we had dinner in the restaurant, which took 3 HOURS to arrive. Other people were coming and going before we were even served. After dinner, we asked for the bill, and the waiter took it upon himslef to just spilt 4 ways, as there was four of us. This was not convienient, and we asked him to reverse it, and charge our individual rooms for what we actually had. This took him 45 minutes, and he still got it wrong, so we asked to go back to spliting it 4 ways. Mini bar and tea and coffee facilities are also extreamly minimal. I did not enjoy the rudness of the staff, and their demands at all. Especially since our company reguarly uses The Swissotel.
