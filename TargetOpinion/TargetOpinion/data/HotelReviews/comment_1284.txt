Lovely room, great location

The Orchard Hotel was a great place to stay in San Francisco. Lovely room, high quality furniture, good size bathroom and a very big shower. The rate was excellent for a central city hotel (just around the corner from Union Square) and you get free Wi-Fi which is a real bonus. Breakfast is available at a selection of nearby diners all a couple of minutes walk from the hotel. I would definitely recommend The Orchard if you're looking for great quality in a central location at an affordable rate.
