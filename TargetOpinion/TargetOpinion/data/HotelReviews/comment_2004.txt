hardly 5-star service

I stayed at the Sheraton for three nights in April 2006. Unfortunately, the whole stay was like a comedy of errors. Firstly, I was overcharged $300 for the stay, and had to have the correct charge confirmed by the reception manager.During my stay, I tried to contact the concierge desk at least three times regarding dinner reservations. No one was available to answer the phone at any time I called over the weekend. Apparently, they had trouble with the phones!Breakfast at the brasserie was disorganised. I had been waiting outside for a table. When I was called in, I was told sorry, please wait outside again, the table has just been given to someone else. When I finally did get a table, there was no chef around to do the eggs, and most of the food platters were empty. Upon departure, I tried to order a taxi for the airport, but again there was no answer.Overall, the service at this hotel was disappointing and staying at Sheraton on the Park in Sydney is not recommended! Try the Park Hyatt or the Hilton instead.
