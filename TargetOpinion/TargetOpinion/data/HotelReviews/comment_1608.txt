Had hoped for more

First of all, the location of the Andra can't be beat. Walking to nearly every sight in Seattle was a breeze. However, I strain to compare this boutique hotel to the others I have visited on the west coast. The amenities were lackluster, the weightroom seemed like an afterthought, and the staff was astoundingly incompetent and insincere. They seemed to know next to nothing about the property or the city, and the management seemed to be hiding out in some alcove behind the desk. Overall, if you have money to burn and are looking for a staff to challenge your patience, you will not be disappointed. Wether that equals a happy stay because of the location is up to you.
