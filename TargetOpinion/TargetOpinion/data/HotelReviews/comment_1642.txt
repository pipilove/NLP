Its not worth it!!!!!!!!

Do not stay here unless you want to be ignored, put on hold, charged un realistic amount of money for room service, I just do not understand this click of a hotel concept whom would possibly want to 250$ and up a night for these experiences?? Could someone please explain this to me???Stay at the Fairmont Olympic next door great service, super friendly staff very welcoming made us feel totally at home and we were not even guests aghhhhhh...............
