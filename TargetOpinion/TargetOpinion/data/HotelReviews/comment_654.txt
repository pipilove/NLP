Highly Disappointed

The Intercontinental in Berlin was highly disappointing to my fiance and I. I was excited when we first checked in because the lobby is very grand and fairly well appointed. The staff seemed nice enough and helpful. The true disappointed came when we checked into the room.The rooms are very TIRED. The carpet from the 1970's has blue bows on it and looks like something from your grandmother's house. The TV was very small and not at all modern, and all of it felt very outdated. The worst part though was the temperature. The room was VERY warm all night long (and this was in a cold night in November). We got up in the middle of the night to crank up the AC and open the window, but the temperature didn't change. Only when we called the front desk in the morning did they instruct us to remove the wood paneling below the sink in the bathroom (which revealed all of the pipes, etc.) and manually turn down the radiator (which was on 5 - the highest level!). I would not recommend staying here, it is not a good value at all, not is it a good experience.
