Really lovely Hotel...shame about the weather!!!

What a lovely Hotel, stayed for 4 nights (2nd -5th April 2007) and really enjoyed our stay. The Pulitzer is in a great location for exploring Barcelona with Metro stations close by. We had a standard room which was exactly as seen on the web-site, maybe a little small for some people but we found it to be fine. Bathroom and bed-linen were very clean, comfy beds, great maid service. The only negative aspect to our stay was the weather: it rained nearly every day but was lovely in England!!!! Would recommend the Pulitzer Hotel to any-one going to Barcelona, go on book it now!
