Worst Ever!!!

So on first impression, all looked ok. Room wasn't ready upon check in but that is normal for me. The front desk girl, Alexis, was not too friendly and rather negative. Then the room came...A search to the rear of the hotel for the elevator. Upon entering the room, the stale air stench was overpowering. The room was old and the price was 400 euros. Starwood should be embarrassed. This is one of the hotels I have EVER stayed at. The room was old and worn. There were small flies in the room. It was very weathered. So I checked out and didn't even spend 15 minutes in the room. They showed me another room but it was just as bad and not clean yet. So I moved to the Amstel Hotel, a true 5 star!
