Great Location.

My partner and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. The hotel is in a great location but that is probably all I liked. On arrival we were allocated a room that absolutely reeked of smoke even though we'd requested non-smoking. I was 4 months pregnant at the time and the smell made me want to be sick. We complained and they eventually agreed to move us to another room. The room didn't smell of smoke, was more spacious so we were really pleased! Until it got to 4am the next morning and we could hear two guys in the room next to us using the toilet, talking etc etc! It was awful! Perhaps we were just unlucky and got the rubbish rooms but I would not stay here again!
