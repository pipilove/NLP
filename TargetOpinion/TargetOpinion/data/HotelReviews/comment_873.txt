Good

 We spent 5 nights here on a recent trip to Berlin. The Good: Location is great, short walk to Potsdamer Platz  nearby S/U-Bahn stations etc. Room (1st floor) was OK. Housekeeping was excellent  the hotel in general was very neat/clean. Staff were friendly  helpful. Car parking was €14 per night in the secure underground car park. Great selection at breakfast with plenty of everything available. No real complaints on anything above.The Bad:NO WiFi access available despite claims (still) on their website. We would NOT have stayed there if we knew this was unavailable.Broadband was, apparently, available in room at a cost of €4 per hour! It's no wonder they scrapped their WiFi service - make more money charging for it! In a $200 per night hotel, in 2007, in a majortechnological European city, WiFi should be available AS ADVERTISED. Very angry about this.Air Conditioning: NONE. It wasn't the warmest weather ever but I needa cool room to sleep in  cool our room was not :( Sure, the AC fan worked occassionally but no cool air flowed from the vent. Some days,the fan didn't even work. Again, AC is something I always look for when booking  wouldn't have stayed there if they said the AC didn't work.Couple of smaller niggles too - asked in reception on our first nightfor a UK adapter but they didn't have any saying they'd all been stolen by guests. It's the first hotel we've stayed in that didn't have an adapter. Our booking confirmation also mentioned our free daily newspaper but staff said we would have to pay for it. Needless to say, we didn't.So, a good enough hotel in a good location with nice enough staff but very angry about the lack of AC  Wifi having spent $1000 for 5 nights.
