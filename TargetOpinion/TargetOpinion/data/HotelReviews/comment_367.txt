Wonderful room. appalling breakfast

We had the corner suite. It was fantastic. Great views, great comfort. The Ritz Carlton showers are the best in the world. However the breakfast, which is not included in the price, was an absolute joke. æ‹¢110 for 4 people!! The choice was appalling every morning. Cold, over salted scrambled egg, cold bacon. Other than that it was just cakes or a few bits of fruit. Never have I felt so ripped off in all my life. AVOID THE BREAKFAST! Other than this it was an enjoyable experience, though not as great as people make out in my opinion.
