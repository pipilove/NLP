Good budget hotel and friendly staff

The Nadia, is a good budget hotel. Ignore the bad comments from other people - they clearly only make complaints and would not dream of writing a good report. As other reviewers have said, the rooms are small, which is the norm in Europe. The manager and staff are great and friendly and most importantly the hotel is clean. If you plan on sitting in your room for most of your stay while in Amsterdam then stay elsewhere, but if you want a good, clean hotel to be used as a place to sleep/base while exploring the city then you can't go wrong with the Nadia.My only criticism is that the bathrooms were a bit too small but again it did the job.
