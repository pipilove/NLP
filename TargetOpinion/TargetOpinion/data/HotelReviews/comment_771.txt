Surly staff and baking hot room!

Booked through Lastminute.com, and like the other reviewer who booked through a BA deal, I suspect thye save the worst rooms for people on these kind of breaks/deals. The rooms are situated around a courtyard and therefore every movement / noise is echoed into the rooms. Our room was like an oven when we checked in, and there was a mobile air conditioning unit which had a long tube you had to put out of the window to expel the hot air - and so had to have the window open...which seems to make having air con pointless! When we went back downstairs, I told the desk staff the room was very hot and the air conditioning unit was very noisy - I was told that no, the unit was not noisy at all! I asked if we could be moved to another room and was bluntly told no. The staff throughout our stay were surly and unhelpful. There was no bath, only a shower. The only thing going for this hotel in my opinion is the location...and I guess they trade off this. Would not recommend it unless you get it on a really cheap deal...but don't expect great service!
