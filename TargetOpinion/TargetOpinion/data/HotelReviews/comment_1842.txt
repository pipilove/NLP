Valet parking

WARNING Do not leave your car in the hands of this hotel. The valets damaged our vehicle while parking it. When we handed over the keys to our car, they did not warn us about the risk of leaving our car with them. We have given the hotel a chance to respond but after months of phoning and emailing their employee Derek Malley and the General Manager, Jennifer Brown, they refuse to accept responsibility. If you are willing to take the risk and leave your car with this hotel, be prepared to wait 15 minutes for them to retrieve the car.Also, this hotel takes many coachloads of tourists. The porters will just leave the luggage of 100+ people across the inside entrance of the hotel. So if you are travelling alone or as a couple, be prepared to carry your own bags and to wade through miles of luggage to get out of the front entrance of the hotel.
