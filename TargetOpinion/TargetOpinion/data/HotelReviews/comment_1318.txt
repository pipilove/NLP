Overbooking!

We had a lot of problems finding a hotel in San Fran for the particular night we were staying there due to a major convention in town. We were supposed to be traveling the week before but my husbands business trip got moved and we had to change the dates. I spent many hours searching for a new hotel and finally decided on the Argonaut. We were really looking forward to it. Today we received a call that they had over booked and rebooked us in the Handlery Hotel and they would be paying for it. Unfortunately the Handlery is no where near the same as the Argonaut. It's less than half the price and looks no where near as nice. When I called te Argonaut back I was told there are no rooms in the city which is probably true since we can't find any either and they over booked as the result of a computer glitch. I didn't feel that the apology was sincere and there was no concern over my wasted time or the effect this might have on our vacation. I think we should have a least been offered a free stay on our next trip to SF. We won't be staying at this hotel or any others that are part of this chain.
