Fantastic!

I stayed at this motel for two nights last week, and found it to be fantastic value for money.Staff were friendly, facilities were great, the motel was modern and clean, and my room was spacious, clean, modern, with everything I could possibly need. I will be returning to this motel in the near future, and would recommend it to anyone else. Absolutely brilliant value for money!
