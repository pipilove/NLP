Yes, this is a lovely hotel. However.....................

This hotel is lovely. However, the maids burst into our room twice on the day we were checking out. The first time before 8:00 a.m., and the second around 9:00 a.m. Upon reporting this to the reception on checking out, the clerk looked at me and said what is your problem? This is a five star property! The maids shouldn't be anywhere near that room until we have cleared check-out. No manners, and I can't recommend this hotel as a great five-star.
