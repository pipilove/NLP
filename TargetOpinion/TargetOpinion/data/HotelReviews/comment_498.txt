very close to metro but restaurant dissappointing

hi Just returned from bank holiday weekend in Barcelona , fabulous city, picked this hotel following reviews on trip advisor.hotel very clean, and rooms spacious, if yoiu like modern you will love it, very conveinent right beside metro/train station, now has tea coffee facilities in room and generally good only dissappointment was the visual restaurant very pricey and very small portions, I went for a take away following dinner ( not good for vegetarians, my portion of pasta was smaller than a starter portion in Ireland) Dublin Ireland
