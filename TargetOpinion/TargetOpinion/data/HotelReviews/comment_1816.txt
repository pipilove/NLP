Fantastic location

Booked this hotel after reading reviews on this website. Stayed for 3 nights with our toddler.Simply fantastic location. A very very short walk to Darling Harbour - a great location as a base to see the major sites of Sydney. We generally ate in the restaurants around the Harbour so didn't eat in the hotel. No view from the room but we didn't care - we were out having fun.Very clean hotel - pretty much what you'd expect + hope from one of the major chains, no noticeable traffic or noise from the other rooms. Friendly and efficient staff (travel cot included without charge). Couldn't ask for more!
