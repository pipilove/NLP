Great Location and Outstanding service

We wanted a hotel with a Dam Square view. the NH Kranpolsky was booked...so we decided on the Swissotel. What a great choice!!! the Service was impecable, and the veiw was amazing. We could see the Obelisk and the trams passing by. The Beds were always turned down, and the room service was quick. The staff were friendly, welcoming and very helpful. From Centraal Station, the hotel is a 5 min walk, or a quick tram ride.If breakfast is not included in your rate, the price for the buffet is a bit steep..17euros a person. that was the ONLY drawback. Art the reservationist at the hotel will confirm and perfectly describe your room to you.
