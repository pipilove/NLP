OK but that's all

We stayed at the swissotel with my 2 year old nephew for the night and booked a room with the hotel directly. While in general terms the hotel was fine, there were a couple of things that made our stay a little less enjoyable. First and foremost the bed was like a rock and both me and my husband had an extremely uncomfortable night. The second issue was that I phoned the hotel direct to ensure that we were given a room suitable for us all to stay in. The room we ended up with was not large enough. To give you some idea the usual bed had been moved (you could tell because the head board is fixed and so the bed no longer lined up) and then a single fold out had been placed in the gap between the one side of the bed and the window. There was no space floor space left between the two beds. We also had no kettle in the room.We have stayed in a wide variety of accommodation on what is a three month trip and based on what you pay this was a bit of a disappointment
