Wonderful time

My family and I spent June 25 through 27 at the Argonaut and loved it. We were steered here by the reviews on Trip Advisor and we knew we made the right choice. First of all is the location... right on Fisherman's Wharf and one block from the Powell and Hyde cable car stop. It is located towards the Golden Gate side of the wharf, near its end and away from the wharf bustle, but certainly close enough to enjoy everything. The hotel was spotless and the staff very attentive and personable. The only minor glitch was a slight delay in having our bags arrive to our room, but this was very minor. The hotel has a very nautical theme to it which we found charming. If a theme hotel is not your bag, then reconsider the choice, but reconsider with much hesitation. A recent review criticized how tacky the theme was. Well, considering that every site that lists the hotel (including its own web site) mentions the heavy nautical theme, the reviewer should have realized this before booking. You get alot for the price of the room and considering how expensive SF is, there is alot to be said for that. Although there is no pool or other significant child oriented stuff, my 11 and 8 year olds loved the hotel, especially for its nautical orientation. Kids are certainly not out of place in this boutique-style hotel. There is a restaurant on site which serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The food was fine, but a tad pricey.You definitely need to explore more of the wharf and the city to get better food. Parking is also expensive - forty bucks a day including tax, but parking is a premium in SF. Would definitely stay here again.
