Nice Suburban Hotel

Nice chic hotel in the area around the University of Washington. Great breakfast bar and afternoon drinks and snacks. The shuttle driver was great - he will drive you the 10-15 minutes to downtown. The rooms come in different sizes. The two other families we were traveling with had larger rooms - see if you can book something larger (especially if traveling with kids). Small well-appointed workout room. I was disappointed that one of the 4 cardio pieces was broken and the staff did not seem too concerned about getting it fixed. It hindered our family of 4 from working out together. Movie theater and restaurants in walking distance.
