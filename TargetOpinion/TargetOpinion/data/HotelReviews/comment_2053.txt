Good Location

Stayed at the travelodge for 7 days in Sydney, best thing is the location - Sydney is massive but you can walk to most places from here, if not there is a good bus link at the top of the road - reception staff help out with which bus to catch where. The hotel was average, the rooms had own fridge, microwave and T.V. They were clean enough, the maid came everyday to change bedding, towels etc they were just basic which is what you'd expect from a travelodge. The safe at reception is free and is also manned 24 hours so they can let you in after a night out! The breakfast was expensive so didn't try but plenty of places to eat in sydney. Overall would stay again purely on location, and for what we paid cant really complain for a city centre hotel.
