The hotel is ABSOLUTELY not five star.The lobby and dining areas are above average but the bedrooms.are way too small,virtually no closet space,and what's up with those heating pipes banging and groaning all night long.Good thing we brought ear plugs....Great location but not enough to sell me for our next trip to beautiful Amsterdam........
