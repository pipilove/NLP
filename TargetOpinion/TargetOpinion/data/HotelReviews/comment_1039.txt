Not exactly what I had in mind.

I just returned from a wonderful trip to Paris. The fact that the hotel was not what I expected didn't impact the fun we had. I always use tripadvisor when booking a hotel room and I am usually pleased with the hotels I get. This however would be an exception. I do not know who is leaving reviews for this hotel but it is not what everyone is saying. There are much nicer hotels in Paris for less money. This hotel is in an excellent location but that is about all it has going. The hotel itself is average at best. There is torn wall paper all over the walls in the hallways, the rooms are large(for Paris) but there is nothing special about them. I would rather have a smaller room with nice linens and a comfortable bed. This hotel was a disappointment.
