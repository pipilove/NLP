'Luxury Budget Hotel'

Our group decided to try Hotel Altamont because of the cheap nightly rates. We had 5 people staying at the hotel and we only paid $137 per night ($28 per person per night), which is actually cheaper then staying at backpackers. Upon arriving, we were surpised to see a small yet cozy hotel and were greeted upon by the friendly manager.We stayed upstairs where the room was very large and the bathroom was well presented. Another door also connected our room to the rooftop area which was an extra bonus!We were definitely pleased with the service and with such a well presented hotel and the cheap rates we got more than we bargined for!The hotel was only 3 minutes walk to the Kings Cross railway station which was really convenient and the hotel was located in a very safe area.We definitely recommend this hotel to anyone! Thanks again to the staff at Altamont!
