Cheap, clean and friendly.

Great situation, within easy walking distance of all the major sites.The entrance is just a single doorway and the stairs to the reception area are the steepest I've ever seen! However we did not have to carry our luggage up or down these stairs.We vacated out room on the morning of departure and the luggage was left in our room until it was put into our taxi when we left the hotel.We also got a free welcome drink when we reached reception on the first day!The staff are very friendly and helpful and all speak English.The rooms are very small and hot. We left our window open at all times and the traffic is very noisy throughout the night. The bathroom is also tiny but the shower was very good. As we only spent a short time in our rooms this did not matter too much.We did not bother to unpack our suitcases as the room was too small for a wardrobe. Breakfast was basic - croissants,toast,cheese, jams, coffee -but it was adequate.We found the restaurants in the immediate vicinity of the hotel tended to close about 10.30pm and the first night we did not realise that there were plenty of places off Dam Square that stayed open much later.A great little hotel but I would prefer a bigger room next time.
