Good Hotel

Booked this Hotel for us and some friends, for our first visit to Amsterdam, after looking at consumer reviews on this web site.Our room was not as large as I envisaged but was very clean and very comfortable. Fully equipped. Bathroom was very nice although we did struggle to get the shower set up so we didn't flood the bathroom!!On arrival, at check in staff heard mention that it was one of our freinds birthdays. A bottle of wine was sent to their room with the Hotels compliments. A very nice touch.Location of the Swissotel is superb. A gentle walk from Central Station and right on Dam Square so everywhere was easy to get to. Good security with key card required to access lifts and stairs to bedrooms.Would definitely book here again if returning to Amsterdam.
