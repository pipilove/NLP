You get what you pay for. . . .

I stayed at the Hotel Victoria during a recent trip to Amsterdam. I think the best way to sum up the trip is to say that there is a reason that this hotel is 50 to 100 Euro less per night than other hotels in the area. The staff was friendly, as everyone has said. Also, it is in a very good location.However, the hotel itself is completely run-down. The carpet in the halls had cigarette burns and stains. The room itself didn't look like it had been refurbished in at least 20 years. Also, the cleanliness of my room was a bit of an issue. (I went to run a bath my first day there and there was dirt and hair floating around in the tub!) At least the construction they decided to do at 8:00 AM on the room next door showed that they have a commitment to renovating the place.I was also irked by the fact that I had to pay 12.50 to use their outdated gym facilities. (I wouldn't have minded paying if the machines had been more modern or if they had charged less for what they provided.)Overall, I guess it was decent value, but I highly doubt I would stay there again or recommend it to anyone else.
