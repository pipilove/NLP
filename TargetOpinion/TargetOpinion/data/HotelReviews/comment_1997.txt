Absolutely worth it!

We stayed at the Sheraton on the Park for our wedding night, in an Executive Suite. The location is great - right next to David Jones and other stores for some leisurely shopping. I think this hotel is great value given how much you would be charged at the Four Seasons or Westin for a similar room.The staff were spectacularly helpful in letting us check in two hours early so we could get ready. They were very friendly and attentive and even left us a cute little chocolate basket with strawberries and champagne. Unlike other reviewers, we did not find them rushed or rude at all.The suite was fantastic with a huge lounge room with corner lounge, desk and comfy chair and a television. The lounge room could be shut off completely from the bedroom which was useful.The bedroom had the comfiest king size bed with a beautiful view of St Mary's Cathedral and Hyde Park - and a tv if you needed distraction.The bathroom was enormous with marble and wood finishing and every nice thing you could think of from the bathrobes to the mouthwash (very important!). My only (very minor) issues were that it took a while to get our car out of valet parking when there was really not a lot of traffic at 9am on a Saturday and there was no-one else waiting to get their car out. Also, breakfast at the Executive Club on level 21 was a bit of an anticlimax. The pastries were nice but the Westin does a much better hot breakfast. The Club itself is beautiful and has the most incredible view, internet access, papers etc.All in all it was absolutely worth it. We have made a pact to come back every year for our anniversary!
