OK, not 4 or 5 star, though Like the Jan.

1st review of the Jamison, my husband and I stayed at this hotel over NYE. It was not our first choice, but since it was NYE, other hotels required either a 6 night minimum or were just insanely expensive for the event. All right, sure the hotel has a pretty convenient location, but it is no 4 or 5 star hotel and should not advertise as such. I'd say it's a strong 3 1/2 star, but that's about as generous as I'm willing to be. Since we paid 5 star rates for NYE, I felt we should have experienced at least a 4 star hotel. We stayed on one of the Club Floors and had access to the club lounge, which did offer a pretty good continental breakfast and evening cocktails. I would recommend staying on the Club Floors if you choose this hotel. Buster at the concierge desk also did a great job for us with our NYE reservations. However, like other reviews have mentioned, the furnishings and linens were a little worn, and there's no dedicated bellman outside. Also disappointing was that the supposedly cool bar and restaurant were closed during our 3 day stay, which was pretty inconvenient on new year's day when most of the city was closed down. I'd say that if you can get a good deal on this hotel, it's probably just fine. Otherwise, the Four Seasons or the Shangrila are a better bet.
