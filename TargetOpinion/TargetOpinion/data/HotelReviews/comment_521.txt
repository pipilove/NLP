OK hotel, great location

I booked the Pulitzer on their Website, after reading the reviews here. It is in a terrific location, on a safe street just steps off the main plaza. We had some minor problems, though. Our first room had non-functioning air conditioning and a dirty toilet. The staff switched us to another room that evening, which had the best shower I've ever experinced in Europe, except that it didn't drain, almost to the point of flooding the bathroom. That was fixed the next day, so the staff did their best for us. We found the stylish recessed spotlights throughout the hotel to be quite dim, especially entering the hotel from the sunny street. We loved Barcelona, and although I'm not sorry we stayed at the Pulitzer, I'd try another hotel next visit.
