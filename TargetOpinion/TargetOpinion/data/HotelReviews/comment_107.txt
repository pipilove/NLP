The room was a nice size however very tired. The walls were dirty and had gouges in them. The comforter, drapes and furniture were in need of replacement. The first room we got overlooked the backside of other buildings. We then moved to a room facing the canal which was a nice view. The bathroom was updated, clean and other than the tub that was difficult to get in and out of was fine. The breakfast was an average buffet - not worth the steep price. After one breakfast ,we went to pancake houses for a more reasonable and better breakfast. The bar and lounge had been updated and was very attractive. I was told the rooms were scheduled for renovation in December of 2007 - not a minute too soon. The lobby could use a little work as well. For the price and rating as a 4 star hotel it was definitely lacking. With renovation it may improve because of the location but our stay left something to be desired.
