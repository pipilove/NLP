Hotel Nadia - Highly Recommended

We stayed at this hotel in 2006 and were so impressed we booked direct with the hotel to return again this year, Nov 2007. The hotel is situated in a nice quiet area close to Dam Square and Ann Franks house. It is only about 8 mins from Central Station. The hotel is very clean and the rooms are cleaned daily. The rooms are not big but then if like us, you just want a base from which to explore this beautiful city, it is perfect. Our room had a TV, fridge, tea/coffee, shower, wc, safe and comfy bed. What more can you ask for ! The staff are all very friendly and helpful. It was my boyfriend's birthday during our stay and when we got back to the room on the afternoon of his birthday, there was a beautiful bouquet of flowers whishing him a Happy Birthday ! You don't get that sort of customer service very often !! We were really impressed. We checked out on the last day and the hotel kindly stored our luggage until late afternoon. Some guests have commented that the stairs are steep, I think there are about 37 up to main reception, but if you are fit and able, this is not a problem. Lets face it, with all the lovely food you will be eating in Dam, then a bit of exercise is a good thing !! I booked a room with a balcony on this visit and it was so nice to sit outside and watch the world go by in the mornings and the view is beautiful.
