Service, Service, Service

Just returned from a 3 night stay at the Argonaut with my elderly mother. The staff at this hotel was unbelievable - from the moment we pulled up to the curb until we pulled away, the level of service was exceptional and almost everyone we met was extremely friendly. Our stay at the hotel turned out to be one of the highlights of our trip. The room was spacious and extremely comfortable. We loved the decor and the staff uniforms. No noise problems as others have experienced. We found a great rate on the internet, then called the hotel directly and they matched the rate. If you go, try Joanies behind the hotel for a great breakfast and Capurro's across the street for a good dinner. Parking at the garage on Beach St behind the hotel is only $26 overnight.
