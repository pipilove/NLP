Hotel needs a restaurant

Based on my reviews from tripadvisor, we just got back from a spring break weekend at the Watertown hotel.The hotel is good accommodation for the price. My only complaint is the lack of any restaurants close by. The closest is three fairly long blocks uphill and it's not in a neighborhood that most people would find really comfortable walking at night. If you want any kind of variety, you have to drive. We also spent several frustrating minuets trying to find Ivor's even with good directions provided by the hotel. Driving around lost, under the I5 Bridge at night was not my idea of fun. The breakfast provided is continental only. If you want a real breakfast, again you have to drive.I might be back, but I'm going to keep looking for a hotel with better eating choices.
