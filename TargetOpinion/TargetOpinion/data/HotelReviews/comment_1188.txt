Good hotel if you are deaf

Recently restored hotel. Very nice decorated room, bed is comfortable and bathroom is convenient. The major problem of this hotel is the thin wall between each room. My husband and I heard all the conversation of our neighbor...Also do ask for a room facing the interior yard... since traffic is terrible in Paris. Also, do not trust the Concierge when booking an early taxi for the airport... Even with 1 day advance booking, our 'booked taxi' (a taxi booked through hotel in the early morning for the airport is usually a friend of one of the concierge staff...) never arrived. After 15 min, we took another one.
