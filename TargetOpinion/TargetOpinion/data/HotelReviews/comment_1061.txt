My wife and I booked a superior room for the weekend. Our room was on the 5th floor. Apparently it was a superior double. The positives : great quiet location, clean , tidy , well lit and had a flat screen tv...all very nice.BUT... it was so small. We literally had 50cms around our bed to change etc and by the time you had stowed away your bags there wasn't any room to function properly.Parisians will tell you that these sized rooms have a certain charm to them and are typically 7me arrondissement but no this was a joke. We asked to see other rooms but true enough we had one of the better ones so we were stuck (although we did contemplate changing our hotel as this was so bad).We got used to the room and after a while it became a laugh but only in the knowledge that we would never never go there again. It might be bearable as a business traveller on your own for a night but longer than this or two sharing forget it.Shame really.
