Will never go back

It was the worse stay we had ever had at a hotel. They were no help to us at all. The concierge had no idea about the sites in the city, how to get there and espically how to get back. After finding a concierge who knew where Fishermans Terminal was she advised taking a cab, which we did. Not knowing that the cabs did not return to that area. We were stuck there for over one hour after calling the hotel for assistance and having them tell use there was nothing they could do. Saw other guests who were also upset.
