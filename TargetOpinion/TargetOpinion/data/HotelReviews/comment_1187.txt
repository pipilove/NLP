Watch out for the Bait and Switch

We booked the Le Walt through Expedia after extensive research. The location seemed ideal, with the Rue Cler around the corner and the Metro right outside the door. We arrived to be told that the previous occupants of our room trashed it and that the painters had to be called in. I had read reviews of other hotels doing this, but was still somehow not prepared for it. We were told that we now had a reservation at their sister hotel, which according to the young woman behind the counter was just 50 meters from the Le Walt. I might not be an MIT professor, but the Marquis Hotel is much farther than 50 meters. While the quality of Le Marquis was fine, it was not what I had booked. When we arrived at Le Marquis - not nearly as charming or well-situated an area, there was another group of people checking in that had been bumped as well. That must have been some party at the Le Walt. I will not book at this hotel when I return to Paris.
