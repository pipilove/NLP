Nice Building - Poor Service

After a very promising reception, our room was disappointingly small for a hotel of this rating without any views. Not did it have any of the normal four-star features like tea-bags, biscuits, pillow chocolate etc. We had to ask for a bath robe. There was no bidet in the bathroom which had an awkward toilet cut-off door arrangement and they seemed to be on a cost-cutting spree here too as they did not replace all the shampoos and soaps daily. On the third day our key would not work and we had to traipse all the way back to reception to be told that our three day booking had mistakenly been entered as two days - for this they did not apologise - and we then were locked out of our room for a further forty minutes while they cleaned the room which they had not bothered to do earlier bacause of the check-in mix-up.The spectalular fish tank in the foyer cannot be entered via the hotel- you have to go around several streets to enter it - at a fee. All in all this hotel should be classified three star and they should send the staff on a training course in customer relations. Never again!
