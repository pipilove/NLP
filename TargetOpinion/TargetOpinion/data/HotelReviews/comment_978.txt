This hotel is a great choice for singles, couples or families.

This hotel is in a great location in the centre of the Latin Quarter. It is very safe, quaint, clean and has very pleasant and most helpful staff!I did not book in advance but just happened to be walking by when I decided to take a look at the rooms which were lovely (but small as most are in Paris) and decided to stay. The next time I return to Paris I would definitely return to this small hotel.
