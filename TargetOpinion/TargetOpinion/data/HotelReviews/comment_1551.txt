Noisy but good value

Felt like a weekend away from the wife and kids (more wife than kids to be honest- I know she wont read this !!) Chose Seattle to do this, as its within easy reach of my hometown Vancouver.Decided on the Moore Hotel,downtown as I'm both thrifty and poor and on reading previous reviews, seemed to suit my budget. Also as I was staying only one night-how bad could it be.On first look at the place from the outside ,I knew it wasnt going to be Buckingham Palace.The lobby is pretty spartan,the desk clerk on duty pretty friendly-one guy in front of me at check inwas turned away as place was full-so book ahead.Was pleasantly surprised by the room-spacious,and clean.No frills,no shampoo etc one bar of soap for all your needs.The mattress felt more like a water bed than a spring one and I almost seemed to touch the floor as I hopped on it.Ok so125 kgs will do it-but crikey some of those bed springs had surely seen better days.Ah now for some TV-but wait no remote-125 kgs jumping up and down to change channels,is not on.A trip down to reception to enquire as to whereabouts of saidremote-shrug of shoulders-our guests take them home you know set TV to CNN for duration of my stay.Off to Pike Place market-a short jaunt from the hotel-fantastic location-a few dubious characters around,but you find that in any major city.Parked right across the road in a place offering a spot for only $5-had to move my car that night to see De La Hoya/Mayweather fight at local sports pub-on return garage was full-now what ? no problem-park on the street for free-after 6 pmand Sunday all day free.Saturday evening and I'm winding down-Seattleites are winding up-the noise level rises to a crescendo-its now 2 a.m.A water pipe ( a prominent celing to floor fixture) in the room,not to be outdone,comes to life with a gurgle and splutterand keeps this up until 5. a.m an hour after the Seattlitesdecide its time to go home.I nod off into a fitful sleep.Something about this hotel though-somehow its quaintand pleasant in an obscene kind of way.Was almost sorry to leave-or was it teh thought of another Monday at the office looming large ? Give this place a go-just catch up on sleepbefore you do.
