Overpriced, not impressed

Disappointed. Paid a huge amount for a Jr suite or shall I say tiny suite no bigger then your average holiday inn, in fact they may be larger in sq ft. Don't let the pictures fool you, its nothing big or special. The bathrooms are so small you could wash your hands as you sat on the toilet. For the three hundred and fifty two dollars per night I expected to have a good experience. That didn't happen. Your dollar will be better spent at the courtyard for half the price. I will not return.
