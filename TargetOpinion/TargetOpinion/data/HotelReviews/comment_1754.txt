Overwhelming service

All members of staff were accommodating, pleasant and helpful. The shuttle service was excellent; the designated pick-up and drop-off points were conveniently located, and the drivers were always available.The manager actually went out of his way to deliver several items that I had forgotten in the safe before I left the city.I highly recommend this hotel, and will certainly stay there during my next visit to Seattle.
