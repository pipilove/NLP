stolen handbag from room - Travelodge Hotel Sydney Wentworth Ave

We stayed here for 3 nights and had our handbag stolen from inside the room. (Nov 24th) The swipe card wasn't working and it was changed at reception early that morning. handbag is stolen in the next 3-4 hours.(between 5am and 9am) After reporting the incident to the hotel they were not very helpful except to tell us to go to the local police station to report the incident. ( Surry Hills police station.) The hotel staff said the room must not have been locked properly but they couldn't demonstrate how the door could be left unlocked without someone holding it open or placing an object between the door and the door frame.(door is designed to close automatically due to its weight)They wouldnt even come up to the room with us to show us how this is possible.there was even implications from staff (not all) members that we might have misplaced the handbag.Some staff even implied that unless we can prove it was stolen then we could just be making it up.(BTW we had no travel insurance so we took the loss) i asked the duty manager if this sort of thing has happened before at this hotel.He replied he was not authorised to comment on that.(what does that mean???)We reported it to the poilce but they were no help. They just gave us a police report number and told us they were quite busy and couldn't come to the hotel. We hope it wasn't an inside job but we had no help from the hotel to explain how anyone can get access to inside a locked room.We were very disappointed with the unwillingness of staff to investigate the stolen handbag and explain to us how a handbag can be stolen from inside a locked room. the security at this hotel is very poor.there is no security cameras on the floors, card access to the elevator is possible to all floors and not restricted to just ones own room floor.there is one security camera at the front entrance and they were not going to review the footage anyway.it would be possible for anyone to walk in and ride the elevator to any floor they desire.but how anyone can get access to a locked room is what has me most worried.we advise people to be cautious when staying here and when things go bad you will not get too much help.only sharing these experiences will hopefully force hotels like this to upgrade security and also to not brush off incidences like this.i hope no one has to go through the nightmare we had to go through which included organising a new passport and cancelling credit cards.i know that these things do happen but the way the staff handled this situation and their attitude and unwillingness to help is what really left a bad impression and disappointed uswe can provide the room number where the thief stole the handbag from on request
