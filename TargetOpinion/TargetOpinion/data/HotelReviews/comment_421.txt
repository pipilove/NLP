24 hours missing

In the past I stayed with my husband in this hotel. I was very pleased many aspects of the it, such as the rooms, the staff, the decoration and so on. The big trouble was when I was taking the plain back home and remembered that I had forgotten a sweat-shirt in the hotel bathroom... As soon as I got home I called the hotel...well, the first call of many more that would come...I gave the exact information about the location of the sweat-shirt and even pointed out that was a rather expensive piece of clothing (more expensive that all my stay at the hotel) and also with emotional value. Despite all the calls, the staff was unable (and not willing) to solve the problem, I didn't have the opportunity to speak with the manager, and they revelled an arrogant and not concerned attitude towards my issue. In sum, in less that 24 hours a client's personal article was lost and no one ever took any responsibilities for it. This is an intolerable situation in any hotel. So, I don't recommend this hotel to anyone, mainly because it doesn't inspire me any trust. In my case, it was a piece of clothing, in any other case, it could be anything much more valuable. Any person can forget anything in a hotel room, so think about going to this hotel twice. Because I am totally certain that shirt was in the room. Three months later, I'm still waiting for a phone call that never came and never will come. Mafalda Silva, Portugal.
