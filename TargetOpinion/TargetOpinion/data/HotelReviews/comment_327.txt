We Expected Better

July 8, 2007-Brooklyn New Yorkthe Majestic is centrally located and makes a good home base to explore Barcelona but for over 300 Euros a night we expected more. Our room was on the first floor overlooking a the street and was quite noisy at night particularly when a couple of ambulances sped by. Also we were expecting a Queen size bed but our bed was two separately made twin beds put together-not what we expected for a romantic getaway. the room was clean and of average size- nothing out of the ordinary. Breakfast was good but the breakfast room was subterranean with no windows and a tad claustrophobic plus the coffee was weak compared to other European hotels. The elevators werent working well and it turned out to be a blessing that we were on the first floor when we had to walk up and down the stairs.
