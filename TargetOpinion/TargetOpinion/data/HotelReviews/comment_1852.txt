Perfect location...

This hotel couldn't be in a better location. Walking distance to the Opera House, Royal Botanical Garden, QVB, the Rocks and Circular Quay ferry, train and bus station. The staff was accomodating and the concierge was very helpful. The only complaint I have is the restaurant in the hotel, Icons. Incredibly overpriced! My friend and I had a steak dinner, it took over one hour for our steaks to get to us, they were over cooked and they not once refilled our water. The meal cost us over $100 and we had NO alcohol. Another morning we thought we would try a quick breakfast. The buffet costs $32 so we opted for the menu. It took 15 minutes for them to take our order and my bowl of Special K cost $6.50, toast $6.50. The kicker was when I saw the waitresses obtaining some of the food people were ordering off of the menu from the buffet! Our overall experience with the hotel was excellent but avoid the restaurant at all costs!!!!
