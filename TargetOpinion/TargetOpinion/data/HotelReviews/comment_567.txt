Very good until the Brits arrived

I'm giving the hotel a good review as I think that on the whole it was very good. Everything said in these reviews was accurate: the room was very clean and well presented, the position was great for us (I had stayed in the middle of the Barri Gotic before, but preferred it here, as we got to go North to the Gracia area as well), and breakfast was very good.The concierge gave 2 excellent restaurant reviews, including Patagonia steakhouse and the El Raco which was 2 minutes away, very unusual, tasty and well priced. All in all, it's usually worth asking, as their recommends were always better than our gos at finding somewhere to eat!Took the Bus Turistic for 2 days (only 23 Euros per person for 2 days, which was a bargain) and had some lovely strolls around the Barri Gotic and the areas around the hotel.The rooftop pool was also very nice, and we had some very peaceful afternoons up there (watch out for the bird scarer - scares the begeebies out of you first time!). On our fourth day, our afternoon by the pool was ruined by a large group of Brits who (as we have seen so many times before on holiday) acted like they owned the place, behaved very badly, were loud, drunk and did not attempt to control their children (one of whom threw a ball off the 9th floor onto the street below). It completely spoiled our afternoon, although we understand that this was not the fault of the hotel.As we were checking out, we noticed that a large British Hen Party were checking in, so we can only think that we timed that right.When will Brits abroad start to understand that there are other people around, and that a little consideration goes a long way.Anyway, please don't let this put you off this very good hotel. We would def return.
