overpriced and not up to usual marriott

We are frequent marriott users and were very disappointed. The standard room was small and could have been any 4 star hotel. The worst thing was the service though. Because we were sightseeing we got back late a few nights and ate in the bar. The food took FOREVER to come and was a very limited menu and not good nor hot when it came. it was almost impossible to get a waiter to take our order for drinks and my husband ended up every night going to the bar and getting them himself. Cocktails are very overpriced, small and not very good. Seafood buffet was good though. Location of hotel great though. We highly reccommend a nearby chinese restaurant to eat - you turn out of the hotel to the right and go up an escalator in the next building along to the first floor. It looks like you are going into an office block but it.s there! The food is wonderful as evidenced by the number of chinese eating there. Also if you go in the door before its a well hidden small shopping mall adn you can get away from the bustle of sydney in a courtyard and get a coffee, sandwich, pastry or go to the chemist or newsagent. We are huge Marriott fans but this hotel was a great dissappointment
