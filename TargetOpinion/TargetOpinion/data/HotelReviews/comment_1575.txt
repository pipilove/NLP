Average, but good for deal received through priceline...

My husband and I work for a luxury hotel company so, our viewpoint is a bit different than other customers. Regardless, there are a few good things to mention. We enjoyed the location of the hotel, no doubt. The beds were very comfortable and if you stay on the 30th floor or above, the views are spectacular. We had a very low rate of $89/night through Priceline with an upgrade to club for only $30/night. However, we were a little disappointed with the selection and quality of food served in the club. Our main concern with this property was that the staff overall was not very pleasant. It seemed that we were a nuisance to most we came in contact with and timeliness of service was an issue as well. Of course, the valet was pricey, but we read the reviews ahead of time and worked it into our budget. This Sheraton is definitely not a 4-star hotel and we had looked forward to a high level of service due to the fact that we work for a 5-star hotel ourselves. So, we would recommend this property if you are happy with 3-star hotels or lower.
