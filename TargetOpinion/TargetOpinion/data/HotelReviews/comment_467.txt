Terrible Staff - Not Five Stars

Quite simply one of the worst hotels we have ever, ever stayed in!The pool is non existent. Don't go there for a pool or any outdoor space.We stayed in a Deluxe Room for a week long vacation on the second floor with a view of a concrete wall! On our first morning we were woken up by staff shouting singing and banging as they were setting up for a party that night. This was at six thirty am on our holiday in a supposedly five star hotel.When we complained the manager said there was nothing they could do. We asked if the party was going to go on late and keep us awake that night and he responded by saying he did not know.So we went out that night and returned at one am assuming that the party would be finished or at least quiet by then this was not the case with a band playing right beneath our window all night until three am!When my girlfriend called reception and the duty manager to ask for us to be moved the manager hung up the phone on her! That has never ever happened in my life!You may think this is just a one off bad experience but it wasn't there were several other instances of not just bad but appalling service even by three star standards.We went to the concierge one day and asked for a dinner reservation he insisted that we take a taxi to this beautiful romantic restaurant he knew of we asked if it was close he said yes five minutes. Forty five minutes later and 40 Euros worse off we were dropped off at a Cafe with plastic tables and a load of Dutch tourists from a cruise ship! Not what we expected when we asked for a high class romantic restaurant in Barcelona!Don't stay at this hotel there are so many better hotels with better facilities and location and most of all staff with brains and some decent training. Even the three and four star hotels would be better than this place. Its a hotel for business guests only or cruise ship guests for one night.Other than that stay away!
