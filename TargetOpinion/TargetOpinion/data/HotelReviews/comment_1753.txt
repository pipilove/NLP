Really nice rooms, nice shuttle

On the whole this is a great bargain and a lovely hotel. The only thing that pushes me from saying excellent is that I wasn't really wild about the university district per se. Although I knew it wasn't downtown, I was hoping for more like Harvard Square and it's more like Westwood/UCLA area. Certainly not the hotel's fault, but not the kind of immediate area you want to go stroll through. Shuttle service was excellent and convenient, used it three times.The room is lovely, well laid out, tasteful.The breakfast had many nice touches - fresh fruit including kiwi.The hotel is such a bargain - over $100 less than downtown hotels.We had the spa cart and really enjoyed it; parking was free, shuttle was free and very easy and accomodating. Very clean, stylish, comfortable bed.I'm sure everyone coming to Seattle will hit Pike's Market, Space needle, and Experience Music Project anyway, but let me just throw in that these were great fun. If you're into music also check out the Larks music store near Pikes, lots of cool stuff to see. Also Crittendon Locks is well worth seeing (in the Ballard area). Genie
