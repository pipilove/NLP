Birthday treat

This was a 40th birthday treat for my wife and what a treat it was. This Hotel is superb. Staff are very friendly,helpful and efficient. Room was large (huge bathroom and private roof terrace) clean and beautifully appointed. Room was in the Royal wing and all rooms on the 6 floor have roof terraces. Room rate on door was 450 euros I paid 145 via internet, great value for money. Location could not be better with everything within walking distance and when you have to many shopping bags just pop back to hotel drop them off and back across the road for more spending. The breakfast is optional and at an extra cost of 21 euros may seem rather steep until you see what you get and the lovely room your are in. Champagne, smoked salmon chef to cook your eggs any way you like and a vast array of fruits, breads and hot and cold dishes. The breakfast room is in the old winter garden which is a lovely ornate room with a very relaxed atmosphere You don't need much for lunch after that. I would certainly stay here again
