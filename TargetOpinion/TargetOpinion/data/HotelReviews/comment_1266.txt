Full marks for friendliness

We stayed here in July at the beginning of our family trip to California, Nevada and Arizona. We stayed in 11 hotels and even though many of them were swankier, Varsa and Sy more than made up for it because they were just SO helpful and friendly (thank you!). Great location, clean, free parking and free breakfast. Enjoyed eating out at Polkers just round the corner. We wouldn't hesitate to return.
