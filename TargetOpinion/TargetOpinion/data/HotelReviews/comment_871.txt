At this hotel double-bookings occur, and they just transfer you to another!

I booked two nights' accommodation for a group of 30 people from South Africa, more than 4 months in advance. Six days before we were due to arrive there, I got a call from them, saying they unfortunately had made a double booking. They proposed a transfer to another hotel, but now we would have to stay in an hotel in East Berling, 15 kilometers away! For this inconvenience the group would receive a discount of 3 Euro and a free drink per person! When I declined, a gentleman from the hotel phoned me, to say that, no matter what we do, there will not be place for us in the hotel, and he adamantly added that they can not give us any more discount. In the end I had to accept unwillingly, knowing that quite a few members of the group, flighing on their own, will not even know that there had been a change regarding the hotel in Berlin, because they had left already on their trip.No matter how long you book this hotel in advance, you can never be sure if your room will be indeed available. Stay away!
