Lovely Hotel, Excellent Service

From the moment we arrived from the UK to the moment we left the staff went out of their way to please us. Walking into the grand lobby everything had an air of professionalism and efficiency. Our room was on the 17th floor with a wonderful view out across to the bay. With this standard of hotel you can expect to find the usual bathrobes and nice arrangement of toiletries, turn down service was provided each night along with the next day's weather report, which was a nice idea. The extra touches made you feel that this was a hotel that really cared for their guests. Within a short walk from the hotel were a number of restaurants, shops and cafes around Union square. We enjoyed staying just outside of the main tourist areas however being close enough to easily walk around to places. We will definitely stay again when we visit San Francisco in the future.
