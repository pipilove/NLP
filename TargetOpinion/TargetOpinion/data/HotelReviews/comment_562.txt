Niggles at the Jazz

Just rerurned from a 3 day break from Barcelona staying at the hotel Jazz. Having stayed in Barcelona on 3 previous occasions, I can safely say this is my least favourite hotel. Whilst the rooms were clean and reasonably well equipped, there was an unpleasant damp smell in the bathroom and no mirror in the bedroom. For those who rely on straighterners or tongs, it was a thankless task styling hair in a steamy bathroom!When the mini bar was restocked it was irratic and on one occassion I had to request clean towels as these had not been replenished by housekeeping. We were room only and were not impressed that on 2 of the 3 mornings cleaning in the corridors started at 8.45, not the alarm call that we had requested!In addition,I can not endorse other reviews relating to the staff. The reception staff were fine but I was rather disappointed that a security guard /concierge (not sure which)watched myself and two daughters struggle down reception stairs with heavy cases without offering to help. The bar, although pleasant ,was irritatating as it was never staffed and it was impossible to get a drink after 11.30pm! The one plus re this area was that internet access is free!I also was disappointed that staff were not more supportive towards a young honeymoon couple whose luggage had been lost and when reunited with its owners was badly creased. The couple asked for the use of an iron but were told that this was not possible and that there was a charge of 5euros to iron each garmentMy main reason for selecting this hotel however was to take advantage of the rooftop pool. On the first day the weather was 21c and I looked forward to taking a dip. I was disappointed by the size, barely bigger than my bath, and the concept that the pool is heated was laughable.All in all a disappointing stay and next time I'll go back to the Rivoli Ramblas!
