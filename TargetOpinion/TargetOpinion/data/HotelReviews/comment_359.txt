Gorgeous but stupid

What a pity to have such a beautifully designed hotel only to let it rot away in its own filth and fill it with dim staff. Stayed in a huge corner suite with beautiful views of the sea... if you can get past the dozens of forehead prints in the windows. The bedding is luxurious but the headboard full of handprints. The Bathroom very large but is moldy, the marble is unfortunately stained, and the toilet disgustingly dirty upon arrival. The maid didn't come for the first 3 days of our stay. We complained over and over again only to have the manager tell us to take it up with Ritz Carleton. Called the RC group only to be told I should have taken it up with local management. The pool area was very comfortable with free fruit, thick towels, hanging beds, magazines... and nons-stop honking and sirens from the city below. I was there on a corporate awards event and was surprised to hear that our problems were not isolated or bad luck. Many people couldn't find their maid, and one colleague had a laptop stolen from his room. The catering of the actual evening events was almost inedible. I do not recommend this hotel.
