Dont believe the hype!

This hotel is not what you might expect from reviews and promos. The outside looks grey and worn and in need of a coat of paint. The bars on the outside windows give an institutional feel to the place and when you walk through the small revolving doors you can immediately notice the difference between a 4 and 5 star hotel no one to greet you or help with your baggage getting a large case through those small revolving doors must be an art form. The six hotel staff are pleasant yet inexperienced and unwilling to help with genuine problems. There are only 51 rooms in the hotel, if you are there its likely it will be fully booked so there is little play with your room. You get what youre given like it or lump. We reserved a deluxe room and were given a standard they then tried to pass this off as a deluxe but when checking friends that were staying at the hotel who had ordered the same room this clearly a standard/superior room, Do they think people are stupid? There is also a wide difference in the amount every one paid some people were unlucky enough to pay 250 euro per night some paid 98 euro no doubt for similar rooms. Food was also poor. When checking in they say the bar is open 24 hrs a day, this isnt true the night man closes it at 0200hrs. All in all Very expensive for what u get its not luxury I am a hotelier of 20 years and look back and laugh about this small hotel. We tried to check out within twenty minutes of arrival they charged 197 Euro......Money well spent
