Unreliable quality and poorly set out.

I have stayed here twice recently and have to say I am extremely disappointed in it. I always stay at Starwood hotels and I have found the Luxury collection to be uniformly very good, except for this one.I stayed during the week on a business trip. The general running of the place was poor and reception was often unattended, when it is they seem to do the minimum they can for you. For example they don't serve food in the bar or restaurant after 11.00pm. Also, simple requests are never followed through and this includes my wake up call which didn't happen and asking for an iron which never arrived. The rooms are also hit and miss, the first time I stayed I was in a great room with a canal view and the second one was tiny and looked on to a white washed wall. For nearly 300Euro you do feel a bit cheated with the whole experience. I really can't see how it gets away with claiming to be in any way a 'luxury hotel. It's a row of houses converted into a hotel which is run in a poor to decidedly average manner. Overall if you stayed once you might get lucky and have a decent experience, equally you could be let down by poorly trained staff and find yourself looking at a white wall in your tiny room.  It's quirky and unique but if you want a reliable standard of room and staff quality I would advise you to go to one of the better know chain hotels, at least you know what to expect. If you want something a bit different I am sure you will find a Bed and Breakfast of better quality at a fraction of the price.
