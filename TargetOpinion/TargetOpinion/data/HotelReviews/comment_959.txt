Left Bank Charm

The D'Albe hotel was a super way to end our two week vacation to Normandy, for the two nights of September 13th and 14th, 2007 .I picked it because of the great reviews on Trip Advisor and easy to find from the airport where our tour ended. We took the RER from and to the airport and 30 minutes we were in a nice hotel room watching the busy Latin quarter bustle from our window. We had a large room on the first floor with 3 large windows for viewing the streets at night. My husband, who is quite picky, said that our two nights at the D'Albe were one of the highlights of the trip. With the windows closed it was very peaceful and very quiet. A very special thanks to Cecile and the rest of the friendly staff at the D'Albe for making our ending to our France trip enjoyable. Tripadvisor member from the state of Nevada
