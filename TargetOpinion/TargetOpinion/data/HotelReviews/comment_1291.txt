A Hidden Treasure

Just like a majority of San Francisco Hotels, the Orchard rooms are on the smaller side, not tiny, just smaller. Though they do have large bathrooms and well lighted, with Aveda Products! I was very impressed with the hotel because of it's friendly, welcoming staff, modern rooms and location. The Orchard is in walking distance of Union Square, Financial District  Chinatown. The price was very reasonable ($149 on Friday, for one night, which included parking and continental breakfast.)One very nice amenity of the hotel is there is a DVD player in the room. It was nice to be able to come back, in the evening, and enjoy a movie. They have a nice selection of movies to borrow at no additional charge. Also, the continental breakfast was very yummy and had a nice selection. With the high cost of hotels in San Francicso, this was an excellent, modern hotel with a low budget price.
