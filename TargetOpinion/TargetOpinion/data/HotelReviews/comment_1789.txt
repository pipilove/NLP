Cozy Hotel. Friendly Staff. Centrally Located

My husband and I visited Seattle from Oct 29th - Nov 1st and enjoyed our stay at the Mediterranean Inn. We had an easy check-in and check-out. We had never been to Seattle, so we had a multitude of questions for the hotel staff, and they were very very nice and always gave an answer with a smile - they even went the extra mile a few times. The hotel also had 2 computers set up with the internet, for guests to use w/o a reservation, and then they also had a business room with more computers and printers. The access to the internet was very helpful, when trying to find new things to do and to check email away from home.The hotel is centrally located. Although it is not in the middle of downtown, it is within easy walking distance to City Center where you can take the monorail that takes you downtown, as well as to the Sonics Stadium and the Space Needle. We stayed on the 6th floor and had a nice view of the lake, as well as the Space Needle (if we looked out towards the left). We took advantage of the outlook on the roof, on our first night (when it was dry) to look out at the beautiful city.As we all know, people that live in Seattle drink a lot of coffee, so there is a Starbucks on the lobby level of the hotel. We did not go to that Starbucks, but it was nice to know it was there.The only quirks that the hotel had was the parking fee and the bed. The hotel charges $12.00 a day for guests to park in the garage. Also, the beds were a bit too bouncy -everytime my husband would turn in his sleep, I'd bounce all over the place and I would wake up with an achey back.All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
