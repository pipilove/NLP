Perfect in Paris!

We stayed at this hotel from 29 Feb - 3 March 2008 - my birthday weekend! I would love to go back and would definitely recommend it for the ambience, fantastic location, totally amazing staff and all the special treats!We felt so special having our very own HUGE Suite in the middle of Paris! How fantastic! We've been to Paris before, and were expecting the usual small, cramped rooms at high prices... but this is different. From the moment we arrived the staff were all so welcoming, polite and extremely helpful. We were thrilled to be upgraded to the Suite on the ground floor - check out the photos on the hotel website - all true! Very groovy freestanding bath and vishy shower.Staff had excellent local knowledge for restaurant / cafe recommendations, and easily arranged a somewhat tricky airport transfer on departure.It was my birthday on Sunday - and when we arrived back at the end of the day of sightseeing, our room glowed with tealight candles, champagne on ice, little morsels to eat, chocolates on the pillows and fresh rose petals for the bath. What a wonderful birthday I had in Paris - Merci!
