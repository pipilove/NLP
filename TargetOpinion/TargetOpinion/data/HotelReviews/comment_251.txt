Think twice, read ALL the negative reviews!!

I arrived tired on the train from Paris and was happy to see the hotel was within walking distance from the station. When I waked into the hotel I knew immediately that the huge amount of money ($440 for a superior room) was not going to go very far based on the virtually non-existant lobby. I got to my room and shocked to see the shabbyness of everything. There had been some remodeling done in the last several years but everything was dinged and dented with tacky bedspread and curtains. The view was out a maybe 2 foot wide window of a ventilation stack, I really was horrified since this is the most I have ever paid in my life for a hotel. I had just paid to $295 to stay on the left bank in Paris!This is the first time I felt that Tripadvisor reviews let me down. I try to read between the lines on these things and I really can't understand how for the life of me how someone could give 4 or 5 stars to this hotel. I called Hotel(--) who had booked this for me and luckily was able to cancel the 3 remaining days without penalty. At least with me the staff was very aloof even after Hotels(--) called them to see what could be done for me...no upgrade offer or free breakfast offer..nothing. I ended up moving across the square to a large 4 star hotel for about 30% less money and the room was 30% larger.
