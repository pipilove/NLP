Super place to stay!

What a treat to book into the Andra while on a business trip. After a spell of bad luck with finding good hotels on recent previous trips, it was a pleasure to stay in a spacious, clean, quiet hotel with friendly, professional staff. I especially liked the wonderfully comfortable bed and the cool bathroom. Also, the guys manning the front door were so very helpful (and cute). Loved the modern decor of the interior. Was pleased to find the hotel centrally located to shopping and dinning in Seattle's downtown district and waterfront. As a picky clean freak who likes nice things, I fully recommend the Andra without hesitation.
