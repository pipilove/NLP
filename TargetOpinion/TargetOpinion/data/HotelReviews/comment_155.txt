Would use this hotel again

Just back from a 3 night break in Amsterdam. The Victoria Hotel is in an excellent location right in the centre.When we arrived at 2.30 our room wasn't ready but they did offer us a free drink from the bar and told us to return in an hour. We didn't take the up on the offer instead went out and got some lunch.I had been told by my sister to watch out as the hotel is known to try and over charge and low and behold when we returned to check in they were overcharging us by 30 euro for each night the receptionist made a call and sorted it out.Wasn't very impressed with the room, we booked a superior room and requested a canal view. The room we got was small and looked out on other rooms.
