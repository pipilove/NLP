Argonaut and SF

Found this hotel very agreeable. Nice touch with the wine hour if you could make your way back to the hotel in time. Room was absolutely fine although no real view for us.Liked the loation as our first time to SF and the cannery bar next door had live music most of the time which we loved. It's not a cheap hotel but the service was fine (if not exceptional) and had 3 good nights sleep with not too far to go to anywhere. Only one minute walk to the queues for the trolley turnaround' and about 12 mins walk to pier 39 and all the touristy things (sea lions) there.Made San Francisco one of our best memories from our RTW trip.
