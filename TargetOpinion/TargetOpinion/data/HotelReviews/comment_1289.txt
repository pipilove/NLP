a gentle stay

the first impression was slightly dissapointing, not as glitsy as the website portrayed and the staff were very busy.However, after the first day the staff were attentive and I saw past the very ordinary facade of this little gem of a hotel. I t is situated beautifully for sightseeing by cable car and walking to the stores. Breakfast is a little monotinous but good food.Watchout for the confusing booking proceedure that myself and a few other guests fell into. We thought we had payed for our stay but had only reserved our room. 1 poor guest had to borrow money to pay the bill.
