Keep In Mind

As others, I did see the positive reviews for the Castle Inn. I thought I'd give it a try, booking it through Orbitz, based on the Orbitz three-star rating it had at the time. I would just like people to have realistic expectations of this property. This is a two-star motel, not a three-star hotel (like the Holiday Inn at Fisherman's Wharf). It has exterior corridors. The room was spacious and clean, but the room I was assigned smelt of cleaner, and it definitely had a motel-type feel to it. Free parking is a big deal in San Francisco. However, the motel's parking is cramped, and I wouldn't advise parking a SUV there (at least not for the faint of heart). The staff was extremely nice, so I feel bad not writing a glowing review as so many others did here.  If you're looking for value in a property situated in town, and you don't mind a motel, than consider the Castle Inn. Otherwise, I would look elsewhere. If you look hard enough, you can get a main chain three-star hotel for just a bit more per night. The Castle Inn wasn't anything exceptional. My main problem with the property was that it was billed as something more than it was -- a motel.
