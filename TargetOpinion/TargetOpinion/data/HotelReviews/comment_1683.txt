Great amenties but tiny room!

The room was lovely, but tiny! Very bright and nicely decorated with wonderful Aveda products. Service was great, very friendly. Great location near shopping for the price. Restaurant was also quite tasty.The only real complaint I have is that the walls were paper thin, our neighbors were living the high-life and stayed up very late! Fortunately the A/C was pretty loud so we turned the A/C on it drown the sound out pretty well.
