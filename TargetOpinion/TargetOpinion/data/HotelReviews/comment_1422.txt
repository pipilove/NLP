We Don't Need No Water Pressure

I was upgraded to the 32nd floor as the hotel was full despite booking my room several months in advance. Whilst I had a room when I arrived, they had messed up the booking even though I called from abroad to confirm my arrival. First note to self-this is a bad sign of mis-management. I was cheerfully checked in and then went to my room on the Club floor. I expected to have a magnificent rooom only to be disappointed by at best a decidedly average room. Not more room, but some tasky nicer appointments. The bed was pretty decent, but the distinct lack of water pressure, without scalding yourself or freezing cold shower does not justify the Club experience in my humble opinion. If you stay here you also get to deal with the hordes of tramps frequently around the outside of the hotel at night ddue to proximity to the Tenderloin district, so take cabs at night. Frankly I would probably not pay my personal money to stay here -- the company paid.
