Tired hotel with overpriced dining

The lobby can be total chaos - counter staff, lots of them, seem to take forever to get things done. You jockey for position with other guests to be served next. They smile and all that behind the counter but are not forthcoming with any information you might need.We stayed in the royal wing which was defintely not royal. you actually have to leave the building and cross a breezeway/lane into the royal wing.The room itself -ooh you have a deluxe room is how the counter staff termed it - wasn't deluxe. Clean, but jaded is the best way to describe the room. Bed killed my back....way too soft.They have a gorgeous looking restaurant and wintergarten but alas so expensive (28euro breakfast) they sit quietly empty.Staff didn't want to give me change for 50euros for the airport shuttle bus - not the treatment you'd expect from a 5 star.
