absolutely the worst hotel

Having travelled extensively in the U.S. and abroad, we were so shocked upon check-in at this hotel that within 2 hours, we checked out and went to the Hotel Plaza Athenee. Vendome is garish, but above all severely lacks tact, professionalism and competent customer service. The room that I booked 30 days in advance was already issued upon our arrival because the hotel was overbooked. I had to ring room service 4 times for a bottle opener for a diet coke, took an hour. Instead of leaving the bottle opener in the room, the attendant curtly stated that it, 'was hers', and took it with her. I attempted to go to the spa for a massage to relieve some of the travel stress, requested a gender-specific therapist (and the wrong gender showed up) and received singularly the worst massage ever. Attempted to order room service for dinner, the room service operator insisted that she would not bring coffee with the entree and that I would have to call back after I finished dinner if I still wanted the coffee. Under no circumstances would I recommend this hotel to anyone much less a saavy traveler or trusted friend.
