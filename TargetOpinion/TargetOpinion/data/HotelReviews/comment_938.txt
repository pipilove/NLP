Clothes stollen from our room on the 4th floor

We were looking forward to staying at this hotel, for the past three years we had stayed in the area and had seen the hotel; we liked the look of it and so we booked our short break. Our room was average and on the 4th floor, it looked into the courtyard, not a huge problem but obviously no views. On our first day we left our room in the morning, the room door was locked when we left and we spent a good day seeing the sights. At 6pm we returned to find things had been disturbed in our room, on opening the wardrobe it was evident that many itmes of clothing and other valuable items were missing. We reported this immediately the reception staff. The reception staff were surprised, and claimed that this had never happened before. A member of staff came to our room, she took notes and remineded us to keep the windows locked; they were. She asked if the clothes were under the bed; they weren't. She said her staff were honest and had worked there for years. She told us that two of the hotel staff had entered the room that afternoon - this had been recoded on the electronic key. Not once did she apologise, she was defensive and we had no confidence that she will look into the theft which we reported to the police. Other valuable and setimental items were taken in addition to the clothing. We left the hotel the follwoing day as we did not trust anyone there anymore. I would NOT recommend this hotel to my friends or family. BEWARE.
