All you could want in Sydney

My family just returned from a lovely stay at the Harbor Marriott. The property was clean, beautiful, and could not be in a better location for shopping in the Rocks district, catching the ferry, or strolling to the Opera House. We will always be grateful to the concierge who steered us to one of the finest meals ever at Aria. Not a place just to go for the view of all Sydney Harbor at your feet - the food was truly fabulous.
