Nice Room

The Silver Cloud Lake Union is a nice hotel. The room was spacious and comfortable. Nice amenities (refrigerator, microwave, wet bar, coffee pot). Nicely decorated, a good-sized bathroom, everything was clean and well kept. The bed was very comfortable. The rate was a bit high but this is Seattle. If you need to stay in the Lake Union area I would recommend this hotel.
