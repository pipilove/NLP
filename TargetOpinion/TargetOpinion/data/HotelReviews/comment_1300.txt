Poor Experience

I stayed here for 3 nights in July 07 for a business trip so a little late in posting feedback but thought I should still contribute.OVERALLI completely failed to see why this hotel is rated so highly. The location and checkin were good but everything else from the lobby, room and broadband were poor. I cannot recommend this hotel especially with other good options nearby. In particular, the Mandarin Oriental is nearby and is often priced competitively which means you'll be paying similar money to the Omni but for a VASTLY superior hotel.Let me emphasize that I do not feel the Omni is bad. The problem is that it is just ok and that there are options.GOODFast checkin. Pleasant staff. Decent location.BADSmall room. Front lobby unimpressive. Broadband speeds slow.
