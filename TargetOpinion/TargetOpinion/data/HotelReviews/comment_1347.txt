Over rated

Just back from a 4 night stay at the Argonaut. Read the rave reviews and decided to try it. I have to say that I think it is hugely over rated. The nautical theme is taken too far and the room decor is over the top, bordering on Kitsch. As there are 2 adults and 2 teenagers in our family, I rang the hotel a couple of weeks before arriving to ask about a rollaway and was told that it could be requested and would cost USD20 per night. I was subsequently advised a week before arrival by our booking agent that the hotel could give us a room with 2 double beds but could not permit a rollaway. Our room was quite narrow, 2 double beds and very limited storage space, 1 closet and 2 drawers under the TV. Bathroom was quite small, made even smaller by their positioning the coffee maker beside the sink ! We had an interior view room, despite having booked a 'Deluxe' category roomWe had stayed at the Quality Inn Midtown in Toronto earlier in the trip and the room was at least 50% bigger and 50% cheaper than the Argonaut.Facilities are nothing to write home about either...the restaurant attached to the hotel The Blue Mermaid is quite nice, good food but not exactly easy on the pocket. Small bar in the restaurant.And I cannot understand how people rave about the location...sure you're on Fisherman's Wharf and there are a choice of restaurants but it is unbelievably tacky with so many souvenir shops and beggars in the immediate vicinity.All in all, a disappointment for what we paid.
