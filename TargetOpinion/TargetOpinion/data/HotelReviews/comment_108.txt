Dissapointed

I have just returned from spending 3 nights at the Park Hotel in Amsterdam (4*). As many people have said the location is decent-not too far outside the main attraction, but then again not too close to hear noise etc. We turned up hoping for a lovely modern room as the website suggests but when entering our room it was pretty dated and not at all modern. We also had a few problems with the room. I had to complain about the iron / trouser press that was hanging off the wall, eventually it fell off missing my foot by inches. This wasn't helped by the light not working directly above it. The next morning we received a letter to apologise for the inconvenience and everything was fixed but in fact the light was dangling dangerously from the ceiling and the iron / press was in the same condition!! Joke! I nearly fell off my bar stool when I ordered 2 ameretto and cokes when we were charged 20 Euros!! We didn't order from there again!! Room service was no good-they state a 24 hour service but that is only for a few items-even then you get charged extra!! Brekkie cost a fortune also - 5 Euros for a bit of bacon and some eggs!! No chance!! The bathroom was fine - no complaints about that, shower was quality but then again the curtain and the rail fell down once when I was having a shower!!  The customer service was pretty poor - upon checking out they mixed my bill up with another persons and they couldn't give us our receipts cos she was doing too many things at once and got them muddled up in between answering 4 phone calls!!  This may sound very moany but all is true. Book very carefully and read through all these comments!!!
