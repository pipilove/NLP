fantastic hotel, well located

stayed at the Parc 55 in september during a business trip. 5minutes from union square and main shopping area.hotel room was spacious clean and gave us clear views of the city. Thai restaurant in the hotel served amazing thai food that was reasonably priced. the sports bar was also a great place to eat and drink. location of the hotel is really well placed - you're in the middle of everything.planning on coming back to SF next year for a vacation and will be sure to book my room at Parc 55 again.perfect place to relax after a hard days work (or shopping ;) )
