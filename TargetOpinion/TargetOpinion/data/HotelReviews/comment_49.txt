Too beautiful for just 1 night

I was recommended this hotel by my travel agent. After reading ALL the reviews at Tripadvisor, I was rather looking forward to seeing the place for myself. I stayed just 1 night in this beautiful hotel. I was fortunate enough to get a room with a canal view and a double bed just for me!! The staff were friendly enough, though I received a somewhat cold and confused reception on my initial arrival. My room looked like it was recently renovated, although the door looked like someone had tried to break into it. At the lobby there was ample FREE muffins, pastries, tea and coffee. The ONLY downside was that I was misled into thinking that the hotel wasn't far from the Centraal train station - in fact, it took me close to 30mins of walking (with luggage and backpack)! *phew* Overall, it was more than sufficient for my purpose - a place just to shower and sleep. I'd love to go back there in the future.
