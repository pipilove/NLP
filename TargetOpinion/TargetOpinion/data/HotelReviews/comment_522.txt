Ok to stay here

I found this hotel pretty average. Stayed in rm117 and the room itself was ok, but in need of renovation. The windows are quite sound proof - but noise came mostly from housekeeping staff, not entirely their fault, just the doors did not keep the sound out.The location is a Big Plus for the hotel as it is in the city centre minute walk from the underground train and just across the square is the airport bus. I think I will try another hotel in BCN next time- but I would stay here again too if needed.
