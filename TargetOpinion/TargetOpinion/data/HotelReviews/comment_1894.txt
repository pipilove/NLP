Nice location and proximity to Darling Harbour

For our 5 night stay, we have asked for a so called Superior Harbour View room?(non-smoking, at a higher level). On checking, the initial room (3 beds, although asked for twin beds, and not cleaned, and the room at low level only, etc.) itself had practically no harbour view - only that of the Aquarium roof and main road below. We refused to take this room - and finally (waiting patiently over three hours) we have got a nicer room and also situated at a higher level, as booked.The best asset of this hotel is its location, its proximity to Darling Harbour and nearby shopping malls, but the hotel is somewhat 'tired' in decor and outfit. The windows are sound-proof (mainly in view of the traffic of some importance), and the beds are good.The internet (wireless) at the lobby is properly working and free of charge (the broadband access in rooms is too expensive).Difficult to say if we would stay there again. Maybe we shall try next time another hotel (the Darling Harbour view is 'nice to have' but not a 'must'). From our understanding, there might be other options in the inner city (and less expensive ones).
