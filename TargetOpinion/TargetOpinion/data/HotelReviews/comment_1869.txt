Best location, best service

Best location and best service--that describes our experience with the Marriott Sydney Harbour. The concierges were the best we've seen anywhere--helpful and specific, volunteered additional information and made suggestions without being asked--all with a smile, of course. The room was quiet, spacious and spotless. The maid even lined up the two under-counter toilet tissue rolls so they were even. The location is just a block from the harbour--even better than a much higher priced competitor. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone.
