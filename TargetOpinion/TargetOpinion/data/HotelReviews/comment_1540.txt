Great Location, Great Value

My husband and I stayed at The Moore for 3 nights/4 days beginning on September 15th. The main purpose of our visit was to see a concert at the Paramount Theatre but we decided to add a couple of extra days to see Seattle. We found the hotel to be a great location to everything that downtown Seattle has to offer. Our room was a good size, clean and comfortable. Pike's Market, shopping and restaurants are all close by. It's true that the hotel does not have the frills of other downtown hotels but, as far as I'm concerned, getting some fluffier towels and free shampoo/conditioner is not worth an additional $150+ USD/night. Suggestions: Woodland Park Zoo (fantastic and worth the 10 minute bus drive out of downtown); Anthony's Pier 66 (excellent seafood restaurant on the waterfront) Enjoy your stay at the Moore!
