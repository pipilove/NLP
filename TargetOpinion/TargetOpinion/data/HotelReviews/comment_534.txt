Great Reccomendation

Stayed at this hotel on the strength of reviews of Trip Advisor. The location was excellent, the staff friendly and the rooms were modern and very clean. The one slight, and I mean slight, downside was that the sound proofing was not great. Our room was just beside the lift and we knew when other guests were coming and going. The pool was a great facility and breakfast was substantial.Would definitely stay there again
