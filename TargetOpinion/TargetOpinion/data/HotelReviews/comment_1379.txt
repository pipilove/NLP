My husband and I always try to get away on the anniversary of our only child's death, March 31st. I had read about the Tuscan Inn and booked it well in advance for our arrival. It sounded like a great place to be for the occasion.We took a train from Santa Barbara, and I knew we were going to arrive quite late. I was looking forward to the assurance of our lovely room awaiting us. As it turned out, we arrived at around 3:00 A. M. totally exhausted. We were supposed to have arrived around 10 P.M.But I had guaranteed with my credit card, so I knew we could just get there and go to sleep.Well we arrived and THEY HAD SOLD OUR ROOM! I was totally shocked.The snide, sadistic clerk at the desk was completely unapologetic and sarcastic. QUINN. He said he found us another room that was like the one we'd reserved non-smoking King. We also always look for free wi-fi. We were taken to another hotel where the room was totally reeking of cigarettes, because it was a smoking room, and 2 twin beds. By then it was almost 4:00 A.M. Internet access was not free.I was so upset and angry, and that desk clerk is nothing but a black hole for Best Western's public relations. There was no MISTAKE-there was no MISUNDERSTANDINGBut there was an abundance of ill will and greed.If a late arrival guarantee has NO meaning, and is not honored by the hotel, than how can I trust their hospitality code? I have NEVER had such a crappy experience at a hotel. I really feel that he sized us up and decided to try to wield power, because there was nothing we could do.I will tell all my friends about this, and we are not, despite Quinn's assessment of our social status, a bunch of unsophisticated hillbillies.This was way below terrible.
