The Victoria is fit for a Queen

Great hotel and in an excellent location. The hotel is near completion of its massive refurbishment and the room I was staying in was clean, quiet and contemporary. I advise a room to the back of the hotel as it is very quiet and you could hear a pin drop. The breakfast was a bit on the high side for 20 Euros, however there are plenty of other places within walking distance which offer cheaper alternatives. The great thing about this hotel is it is directly opposite Central station which is a huge plus point if you are passing through with heavy bags or are coming from the Airport. In my opinion the customer service is second to none in this hotel and the staff were very courteous and were always available to help when needed. I would stay there again even although it was a little expensive, but there again Amsterdam is an expensive city to visit at the best of times. The car parking in Amsterdam is expensive, so if you are taking a car expect to pay in the region of 40 Euros for 24hr parking. However, The Vicotria will give its hotel guests a 10% coupon off P1 parking rates directly across from the hotel which saves a little money. Ask at the front desk for the coupon and they will be happy to give you this.On the Whole I'm satisfied with the Victoria hotel more so for the lovely staff that work there and the efforts they make to make sure you have a pleasant stay. One final point, many people complain about the renovation work being done, however this is for the benefit of all future visitors to the hotel, which shows the hotel is investing in the visitors welfare to ensure they have a pleaseant stay. This is one of the reasons I shall return to this hotel if I ever visit Amsterdam again.Hope this review helps.
