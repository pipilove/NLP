Good value but you get what you pay for

My wife and I did a 2 week of tour of Europe with stops in London, Rome, Florence, Venice and finally Paris. After reading the reviews here, we decided to book 3 nights at this hotel. Here are the pluses and minuses:Pluses- Good rate for Paris (92Euro/night); close to metro stops (we got around most part of Paris either by hopping on the #7 at Place Monge station down the street or #10 at Cardinal Lemoine up the street); plenty of bakeries, restaurants, and groceries stores around; relatively safe part of town; friendly staff; clean room and good housekeeping service.Minuses- Room, elevator, bathroom, shower stall, and even tv were very small (granted we only slept in the room at night but it's a bit trying to have to climb over your suitcase to get from one side of the room to the other. Definitely not for the claustrophobic); old and musty smelling towels; air unit didn't work; you have to turn your key in to the front desk when you go out and retrieve it when you come back (a hassle if you need to go in and out frequently); very thin walls and door (we could plainly hear all our neighbors in the hallway and in adjacent rooms. Bring your earplugs if you're a light sleeper like me); inexplicable phone charges (we were told that it costs .50 Euro for 5 min local calls. We placed 3 brief local calls for a total of about 5 minutes and were charged 5.20Euro. We were late for our flight so did not dispute).Overall, this hotel, with the exception of the one we stayed at in London, was the worse one during our travel. Granted we had to pay more for the better ones. I would look around for a better one before staying here again.
