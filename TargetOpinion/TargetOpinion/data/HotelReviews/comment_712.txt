Try to avoid at all cost

We joined a tour group out of Singapore to Eastern Europe and our last stop was Berlin. Very very unfortunate for us that Park Inn was fully booked and the tour agent booked this hotel. Firstly the impression we got from the room was that it is not a hotel but looks more like a service apartment. THe room and hallway has a bad smell. the toilet to our disgust still had the remains of the previous guest!!! The front office staffs were very RUDE indeed towards our guide and us. They even lock us out of our room when we got back 1 hour late. Try to avoid this place if you can. We will certainly not go back there.
