Nonexistent service

This hotel should be called Backpackers Wentworth not Travelodge.Though the rooms themselves are adequate there is no sevice to be had for any price.The harassed staff at reception is unable to offer any local knowledge or information to visitors. When asked to call a taxi we were advised to stand on the corner of the street and flag one down.We left our room at 10 a.m. and left a card to have it serviced. On our return at 4 p.m. we found it exactly as we left it. It took two phone calls to reception and 45 minutes to have fresh towels and other supplies delivered and the service person who finally turned up told us that it is hotel strategy not to make up occupied rooms until late afternoon and evening.
