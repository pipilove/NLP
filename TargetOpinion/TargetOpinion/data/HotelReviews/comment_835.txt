Bad experience!!!

This is not a bad hotel, but I had here one of my worst experiences ever. I stayed at the Agon Opera for 5 nights during February. Upon arrival, I noticed the huge windows of the room were all dirty with heavy dust, paint and gaffer tape - from INSIDE! For 5 days, I've talked to 3 different concierges - they all apologized and said they were going to take care of it. Nobody did a thing! Manager was never on the hotel because he lives far from the city and is always very busy. On my last night there, I threatened to call the police and the concierge eventually had me the manager on the phone. He couldn't care less about the situation!!!
