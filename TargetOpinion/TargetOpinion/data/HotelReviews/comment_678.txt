book somewhere else

unfortunately this hotel is extremely disappointing. the hotel has had a facelift, but the workings underneath are old. for instance, my door didn't even close properly - but after requesting to change rooms i found out none of them do! all the doors are warped but instead they spent their renovation money on new bedspreads. it was a sign i should have checked out immediately - at one point there wasn't even hot water in the hotel for over an hour. staff were less than helpful. meanwhile the lovely modern shower fixtures fell off the wall every single morning while i took my (occasionally cold) shower. if you're looking for a high end hotel i suggest you go somewhere else.
