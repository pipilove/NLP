Good hotel, good location

Stayed here for 3 nights in July 2004. Found it as you would expect for a large chain hotel. Large, smart lobby, check in staff advised us on safe areas to walk at night on arrival. However they were unable to locate the safe we apparantly had in our room! Friendly attendant in the swimming pool/gym, although lots of kids in the pool. Room fine - clean  fair size.
