writing it in my room

I am writing this while I am at the hotel. First time ever did not have my room made up when I got back to my room. Didn't leave my do not disturb sign on all day. They just missed my room. Called 5 minutes ago to tell them told me i had to have left my do not disturn sign on my door. Dont my people making mistake, mind when they tell you its your fault.
