Nice Hotel for European Standards, but with Problems

This hotel was very nice. The room we received was very large even for American standards and two walls were windows so we had a great view. The bathroom was sizable as well. There was a bathroom with lots of amenities and separate shower. There were large closets, two tables, two chairs, large TV, and even a radio. The only problem was that when I had switched on a light, the circuit blew and we ended up sitting in the dark, along with our next door neighbors. The hotel staff came in and tried to fix the lights, but they could not. They gave us another room. That room was equally large. However, the bathroom wreaked of sewage. It was disgusting. The room also faced Sants Station, which was another negative. After going through the fiasco of packing up and moving late at night to the 2nd room, we found that the construction was still going on and would keep us up, if the smell of the bathroom did not. We went back down and asked for another room. This time, we got a smaller one, but at least the bathroom did not smell and we weren't facing the construction. However, by the time we went to bed, it was quite late.All in all, even though we had to go through this fiasco of changing rooms, the staff was accommodating. The location of the hotel was convenient. Sants Station was just around the corner and you could get anywhere form there. The train from the airport went straight here as well. There was a supermarket next door to obtain any necessities or food that was desired. It was convenient overall.
