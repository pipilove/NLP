Wasnt that bad

Arrived from the station, to find hotel in a GREAT position, right over the road, no problems checking in the lady on reception was polite and helpful, as were all the other staff, our room was on the fifth floor, both room and bathroom were clean. Great shower!!The view was distracted with building work, but with no fault of the hotel.Didnt get chance to use the leisure facilities, but did go for a quick look and if we had stayed longer would have tried out.Loved our first visit to amsterdam and will come again and would stay back at this hotel.Would recommend the ice bar too to any future visitors, tho it was smaller than we thought, but then it wasnt too busy so didnt bother us.
