A pretty good little hotel

I was very pleased with my stay at the Mediterrenean especially for the price. While not downtown we were within walking distance to the Space Needle and what is called Seattle Center. No air conditioning but comfortable with the fan in the room although leaving the window open at night left you listening to whatever or whoever decided to make noise outside...The rooftop view is great, everyone who stays here needs to go and check it out. Beds comfortable, rooms and bathroom good sized. My only complaint is the staff didn't seem to know anything about Seattle. When asked about dining or anything else was told, Don't know anything about it. Check out the Mecca Restaurant down the street for breakfast...told it was a greasy spoon but the food was great, even if they give you enough hash browns to serve an army! Safeway across the street and ATM also across the street..easy to catch cabs or the bus if you like.
