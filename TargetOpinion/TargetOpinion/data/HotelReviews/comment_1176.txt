Excellent!

The Hotel was brilliant! We had excellent service all thanks to the people [receptionist, porters, maids etc] .Everyone was very helpful and polite, who also all spoke english which was very useful to us as our french is not the best.Our room was very nice and immaculate, [cleaned and tidied after we came back from our days out also]. The Hotel in my opinion is worthy of more than 3 stars.The location of Hotel de Varenne was spot on too, we did not bother using the metro/buses etc as all the sights were within walking distance.We will definitley be staying here again when we next vist Paris.
