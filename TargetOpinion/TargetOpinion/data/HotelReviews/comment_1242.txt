happy and satisfied

I booked the evening for my girlfriend and I to stay on a wednesday night in the city. She arrived earlier and had no problems checking in. The location was great, right across the street from the Sir Francis Drake Hotel. The booking staff was efficient. The concierge wasn't too helpful, and looked at me funny when I asked if anything 'special' was going on in the city during the evening. Our room was reasonably sized for san francisco. It was on the fourth floor and we used both the elevator and the stairs. I requested a quiet room which was an option on the hotel website. We didn't have any problems with noise. The bed, TV, bathroom were all fine.There were a bunch of coupons in our room for discounts at retailers and also for discounts at the hotel bar. So, we went down to the hotel bar and had a couple of drinks, which were good. We went over to the Starlight Room on top of the Sir Francis Drake hotel during the evening, which was fun.On the whole, it was a pleasant experience and a great location to hang out from. I can imagine a better hotel experience, but I'm not sure I'd risk a worse one by straying from this hotel the next time we go to to the city.
