Great Family Hotel

August 05 - We spent a week at this family-friendly hotel during our first trip to the Pacific Northwest. We found the room was clean, staff very helpful  friendly, and the breakfast buffet was good and had enough variety for the week. We tried to eat out on the balcony as often as possible. We arrived on a Tuesday, to a lounge happy hour, where my husband was happy to sample local beers, and my almost 2 yr old son happy to nosh on fresh fruit, cheese  crackers. The outdoor pool was usually busy, but very nice. With the price of gas so high, we used the courtesy shuttle several times, and even arranged for it to pick us up downtown several times. The waterside room was definitely worth the extra $10 for the entertainment of watching the float planes plus the sunsets. Quick walk to several good restaurants, and even a small playscape for the little one to run around. Guest computers to check email also very much appreciated. We'd stay there again in a heartbeat.
