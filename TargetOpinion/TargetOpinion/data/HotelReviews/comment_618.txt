would highly recommend

I stayed at the Westin in mid september after having stayed there in 2005. I have always like the location and was very impressed with the recent improvements. The room was great with a modern updated decor. Most importantly, the staff were very helpful and friendly. This had not been the case in 2005 when folks seemed cold...so I really highly recommend.
