Underwhelming

Stayed at the hotel Royal in Feb.The location is fine but the hotel is just ok.The staff were civil but not at all helpful.The halls and lobby are very dark and while the hotel is very clean it has a dreary quality about it. Lots of british soccer fans were staying there when I was there (Chelsea vs Barca) which was fun, but I would not stay there again.
