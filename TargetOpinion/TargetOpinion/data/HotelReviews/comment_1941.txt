Experience a True Hotel

It's true first impression last!!! Firstly, I must admit that Market St is a challenge only If you are driving, as it actualy reminded me of Asia/New York bad traffic!! from the moment we arrived a friendly hotel staff welcomed us with a warm smile and we were escorted to reception on the 8th floor!! wow what a difference from the lobby in ground level it feels that heaven opened the door for us. Reception clerk were freindly and fast. Swissotel is in the middle of the city, you can walk to the Historic Rocks for approx 15-20 mins, Darling Harbor 10mins and shopping is just around the corner. This hotel is a TRUE hotel so do speak, the staff are freindly and approachable specially the concierge staff who are helpfull and Mr know it ALL.Thank You Swissotel you will see us again.
