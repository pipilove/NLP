Not up to the usual expections of a Four Seasons

Four Seasons Sydney is a takeover of a prior hotel--I think the Regent. The rooms are small but well appointed. We had a full harbor view room and the view was great. The front desk staff was friendly, but the concierge desk was shortstaffed, misinformed, unintelligent and screwed up reservations that we had made with them in advance. They did fix the mistakes but were very disorganized. The maid service and trundown were intermittent--and when they did come they didnt even leave a card at night with the weather for the next day. I have stayed in many Four Seasons hotels and this site is not up to the others. However, there location is fantastic, and maybe that is enough for them.
