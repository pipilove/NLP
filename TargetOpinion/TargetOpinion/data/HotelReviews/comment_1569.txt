Goods and Bads

I stayed at the Sheraton for four days in May 2005. The goods: Location: Great. Walking distance to almost everything you'd want to see in the downtown area.Rooms: Really nice. Light soothing decor. Very comfortable bed with a variety of pillows. coffee maker. Concierge: Very helpfulThe bads:Elevators: -- not enough and very slowCoffee shop: -- ridiculously expensive. There is a $20 breakfast buffet that didn't look spectacular. I only wanted oatmeal, juice and coffee so ordered from the menu. The bill was still $20.Desk staff: Well -- After being notified by phone message at 5:00p.m.on Friday night that a fax was waiting for me at the front desk (the business center was closed), when I went to get it, the staff couldn't find it after 15 minutes of searching. I told the desk person to find it and I would pick it up after dinner. At 9 p.m. I asked again. After 20 minutes the desk person said, that must have been a duplicate message and there was no fax. I said I doubted that and said that I was expecting a fax. I asked that the fax, when found, be delivered to my room. At 10:00 p.m. the fax was slipped under my door. It had actually been received at the hotel at 10:00a.m. on Thursday morning -- 36 hours before I received it. As it was after business hours there was nothing I could do about the important message that needed a timely response. I complained to the manager on duty the next morning and she did apologize and she credited $75 against my hotel bill. That did not compensate for the cost to me because I couldn't respond to the fax. Would I stay there again -- Maybe. It was better and less expensive than the W Hotel, where I stayed a couple of years ago.
