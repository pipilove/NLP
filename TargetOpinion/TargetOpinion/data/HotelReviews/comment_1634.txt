Never Again....

I don't usually write reviews but feel like I should warn the unsuspecting. Worst hotel I've stayed in. Hallways are dark with a subterrain feeling. Rooms very small with LOW ceilings. No pop machines in the ENTIRE hotel. So either bring your own or pay $4 a piece from mini bar. Not a phone book in the room, had to call for one. Bed was comfortable and room service food was good. But the lobby was small and dark lobby with stairs down to fireplace, chairs, and bar. Also everything they do is by text message to you. This feels very impersonal, I like to connect to a person. Parking was over $35 a night!! We had an above standard room and we still were charged $20 a day after tax for wi-fi...I will never stay in a W hotel anywhere. Perhaps 20-yr olds would think this place cool, but anyone that has seen the world via hotels will NOT find this appealing,.
