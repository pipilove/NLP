Fine enough, a pleasant stay

Stayed here for two nights on tripadvisor recommendation. A pleasant enough experience. Reception staff professional, room adequate, very nice location. Starting each day with a less than two minute walk to Notre Dame and a leisurely stroll down the Seine is pretty blissful. Amazing pastries served in the hotel breakfast room -- make sure you try them!! I'd most likely stay here again when I visit Paris.
