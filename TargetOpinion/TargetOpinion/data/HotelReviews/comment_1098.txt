High expectations; serious disappointment.

After much research (Trip Advisor  every other source we could find) we were thrilled to be able to book three nights for our family of four at the Hotel Langlois. The chance to stay at the #4 rated hotel in all of Paris for a very reasonable price seemed like a wonderful opportunity. We were assigned to the attic apartment where we found our room to be nothing close to the photos and/or room descriptions on the internet. The Hotel Langlois website speaks of Ecole de Nancy furniture  crafted mahogany and sycamore headboards ... Our double bed was a portable bed w/ no headboard, sitting about 6 inches off the ground. I don't believe Ecole de Nancy furniture includes the wicker and particle board pieces in our room. Paint was peeling off the walls in several places. The space had great potential. - It was good-sized (the reason they told us we were placed there). There was a small kitchen. The bathroom was nice. And there was an incredible view of Sacre-Coeur. But it was as though the room was an afterthought. - A place for families when everything else was occupied. Certainly not representative of what I would expect from the #4 hotel in Paris. I would suggest that Hotel Langlois paint  furnish the attic so that it measures up to the rest of their facility. A little work and a small investment would make that space a highlight of a Paris vacation instead of a source of disgust and disappointment.
