Great Hotel

My husband and I stayed 3 nights at the Hotel Pulitzer in December 2006. It is in a fabulous location just off Placa de Catalunya therefore very convenient for the subway, tourist buses and the shops.The hotel has very modern decor in black and white, which is reflected through the foyer, bar area and dining room. The bedroom was very chic with comfortable bed and the bathroom was sumptious. All the towels were soft and white, all the accessories were included, in case you even forgot a toothbrush. I was well impressed with all that!We had breakfast in the hotel and was well impressed with the variety of food on offer. I'm not sure how much the breakfast was, as ours was included in a very good rate we had. I'm sure it would be worth it though, whatever it is.My only problem was we were on the first floor overlooking the main entrance of the hotel; deliveries started at 5.30AM to the hotel and neighbouring shops so sleep was hard to come by once I was awake.The staff were wonderful, friendly, polite, helpful but also a little cross that I didn't ask for a quieter room when I remarked about the noise when we checked out.. So if you stay here and you are a light sleeper ask for a back room!All in all though a great place to stay.
