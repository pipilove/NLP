Terrible Security, could not recommend

Would not recommend this Hotel for the following reasons -Lack of security, we returned late to this Hotel only to find a drunkhomeless person entering the Hotel, not once was he challenged.The front entrance was covered in falling leafs from the trees inthe Park and as it was a rainy day made the area very slipperycausing me to loose my footing.The room light did not work and was covered in dust, windowswere that dirty we could hardly see out.Not what one would expect from a 5 star Hotel
