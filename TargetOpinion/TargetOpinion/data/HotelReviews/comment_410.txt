Unwilling Management

We spent a nice time in barcelona. My husband, my two taughters (12 and 14 years) and our little son (baby). The hotel is nice but there is a lot of traffic noice also during the night. So you must keep the windows closed. The hotel bar is realy bad - sorry for that. The hotel offers a good continental breakfast.. If you make an online reservation, it is impossible to mention that you travel with children. So an adults room price will be charged for them, if they stay in a seperat room. Neither the hotel staff nor the manager was willed to change the fee to a children rate, only the baby is free of charge. That is realy a shame for a hotel with four stars.That's the way a satisfied guest leaves the hotel angry and dissatisfied.
