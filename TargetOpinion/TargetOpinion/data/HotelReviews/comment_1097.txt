Are we talking about the same hotel???

I too recently stayed in Room #31 as part of an 8 week trip around the world and Hotel Langlois was the worst room hubby and I encountered. True, it was a large room with huge bathroom but the 'antique' furniture for us meant old and broken. One bedside table door and one cupboard door didn't open, the bed creaked terribly (as we know the floor does too) and was a double when we had been confirmed a queen. The 'log' style pillow was very uncomfortable. Acoustics where poor, we were asked to turn down the TV which we did not have up very high. Room was so hot we had to request a fan. There were no tea making facilities. As for the convenience of the metro a few steps away, we could hear the underground trains rumbling by all night! The room is certainly affordable and the staff are very helpful but I would not recommend the hotel.
