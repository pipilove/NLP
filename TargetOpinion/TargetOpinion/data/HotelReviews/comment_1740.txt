Didn't honor 2 double bed reservation

The hotel is in a nice area, except at night, when there are lots of homeless who show up a block or two away. Staff are friendly, but they refused to honor my 2 double bed reservation. They did offer a cot, but when you are on a business trip, it is hard to decide which person should stay in a cot at a 5 star hotel. If you need a guaranteed room type (1 or 2 beds), this hotel is not for you. Otherwise, if you feel lucky, give it a try...
