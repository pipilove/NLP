Room fine..neighbours not!

Overall a good no frill hotel. Clean room and bathroom. Staff very pleasant and helpful. Location great, near Hyde Park and Oxford Street. Not that far to walk to any other attractions. My only misfortune was that an american teenage convention also stayed at this hotel at the same time. This meant lots of door slamming , excited high pitched voices, noise through the walls etc. However, I have stayed before and it was fine. Teenagers just being teenagers, but at 2am....i prefer to be asleep and not woken up by excited loud teenagers.
