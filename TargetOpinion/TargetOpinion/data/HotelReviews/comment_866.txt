Disapponted

Booked the hotel for two nights to celebrate a part of our honeymoon. We read about the hotel in Wallpaper guide.We ended up leaving one day too early as we were so disappointed about the rooms and especially the service.Service: BAD!!!- We had to ask several times to receive a confirmation of our booking- There was no more parking spaces left for our car and they dont have valet parking. Thus, we had do drive to a near by hotel to park our car-We called to ask if it we could cancel our room for the second day and was told it would not be a problem. When we then checked the day after they wanted us to pay for the second night despite what they informed us the day before. After a long argument they agreed to cancel without penalty as promised.Rooms: Do not live up the the price-Nice design, spacey, nice colors-Shower/tub in same room next to bed (guess some people like that)-No minibar-Small kitchen if ones wants to cook-Beds short (if you are over 190cm tall your legs will stick out)All in all very poor hotel considering the price they are asking.Second day we switched to Bradenburger Hof, which was fantastic and at about the same priceWill never be back.
