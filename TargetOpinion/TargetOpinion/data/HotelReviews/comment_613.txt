Not exactly what the website says!

Bit of a dissappointment to be honest. Rooms needed upgrading badly (and our view was of the roof!) and a good clean! The wing where our rooms were had bad smell. When we complained about the smell the staff simply told us to open the windows. Some staff were very nice and helpful and others were not at all. When we mentioned our room hadn't been cleaned one day they simply dumped clean towels in the room and didn't even tidy up!There was also some inconsistency on the service...we were there with family and our room got turned down every night and a free bit of chocolate while the other room never got that...and we all checked in together and paid the same price!
