Nice hotel, staff somewhat lacking

Very nice, clean, modern hotel. Excellent roof top pool (weather permitting). Staff not very enthusiastic, helpful or proactive, apart from the boys in the bar, who were friendly when approached first. Better for couples with an idea of what they want out of Barcelona. The room wasn't huge, but was very nice. In Aussie dollar terms, value for money was ok, but not great. We were just dissapointed with lack of staff interest - did not help us get to know Barcelona at all. Mind you, we did not encounter many friendly locals in a 7 day stay. Is anyone working in Barcelona actually from Barcelona? No one seems to be local, and none of them seem to like it there. We stayed in Apartments in many other cities, and should have done so here, as the hotel staff were of no real help at all.
