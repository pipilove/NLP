Need to be more consumer friendly

Checked into Alexander Plaza on a Friday afternoon for two nights. Was told that my prepaid room was on the 6th floor and, due to construction, the elevator only went to 5th floor. I'd have to schlep my bags (and myself) up and down the stairs everytime I wanted to go in or out. What an unpleasant surprise! They didn't even offer to have someone carry my suitcases up the stairs. When I mentioned my knee surgery (cane was the tip-off), they made a big show of reluctantly upgarding me to a double on another floor. Tiny room (upgraded!) that looked out on a small interior space--had to keep curtains drawn at all times to prevent office workers across the airspace from looking in.Recently renovated hotel is in a great location for walking to museums and shopping in an interesting gentrifying section of East Berlin. Wait staff at the bar was very pleasant.With all lights on, the room was dark; poor lighting except next to the bed; tiny bath with 30x30-inch shower; only one towel until I asked for another; 17 Euro breakfast that was just okay in content; Business Center that was closed of the weekend at 4p on Friday.
