nice offerings but pricey greeted by friendly/helpful evening staff (great recommendation for dinner).

Free underground/secure parking was bonus. Room was clean, comfortable with nice touches of alcohol pads by phone/remote, filtered tap water, micro, fridge  safe, robes for lounging (though not worth the $75 they were selling them for), cozy bed/pillows. Arrived late in evening so didn't partake of ala carte carts. The shower was decent...head high enough so my kind of tall husband didn't have to crouch, rounded curtain rod but shower/toilet area small to begin with, could have had more/larger towels available, Aveda products. Large sink/counter area but could have used the space to make shower/tub/hotel larger...especially in a suite room. No phone by bed, alarm clock complicated but not utilizing wake up call or alarm so didn't care too much.Breakfast  eating area was decent. I've had better buffets (no waffles) but lots of healthy choices. No highchair so eating w/ toddler challenging and no car seat available for us to utilize complimentary shuttle to shopping. Unfortunately fire alarm went off @ 6:45 AM (toaster in kitchen). Did try to extend stay and negotiate lower rate since we would have to change room. Morning desk staff not quite as helpful/friendly. No discount offered even w/ alarm snafu. Overall...a bit overpriced even for 'boutique' hotel though it had nice offerings. Have never stayed in a hotel that was unwilling to negotiate on rate. Good job by housekeeping - room immaculate. Don't get a room near ice machine. I felt guilty getting ice @ 10PM because of the noise.
