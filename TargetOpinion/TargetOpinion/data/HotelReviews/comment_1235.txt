Great Place to Stay

We had booked into the Chancellor for five nights from the 5th August. I had emailed Wes Tyler requesting a room on a high floor overlooking Union Square and mentioned that it was my wife's birthday on the 6th. We were extremely pleased with the room we were given and my wife was very surprised and happy to receive a birthday card from the staff, together with a bottle of wine to celebrate and a gift of a photo frame. Fantastic service from Wes and I would also like to say what good service we received from Mao and Sue.All together a wonderful experience at a great place to stay.
