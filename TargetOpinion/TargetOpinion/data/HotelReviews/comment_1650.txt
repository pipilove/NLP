Thumbs Down from a Starwood Preferred Guest

Despite having made a reservation for a non-smoking King, I got stuck in a Double Room overlooking loud external air vents and near the elevator. To top it all off, my next door neighbor turned up his bass to party at midnight. Hotel staff wasn't especially responsive with regard to giving me a quiet room. So much for being a Starwood Preferred Guest and paying over $300 a night. I'll remember to stay elsewhere next time I'm in Seattle.
