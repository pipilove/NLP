Excellent Hotel Choice in Seattle

I spent six nights here at the Watertown and cannot say enough good things about this hotel and the service. Many extras not usually found in a hotel at this price range make for a very comfortable stay: free Internet, cookies in the afternoon, free Happy Hour every weekday, hot breakfast, complimentary shuttle service to downtown, and much more. The front desk people could not be nicer or more helpful. The rooms and beds are very comfortable and very clean. An excellent choice overall.
