This hotel ok but This hotel in the Edge of C B D district of Sydney.

Well placed .But the hotel has problems the room was ok had small fridge and micowave oven and one small Chest Of Drawers with 2 Drawers and one wardrobe ok for short stay but if staying over a week then not enough room. The carpet in the room was quite stained and never semed to be cleaned the room did have a maid that did ok (allways clean towls emptyed bins did the bed ect ) but did not seem to clean the carpet.All so the toilet roll holder was near enough off the wall no one seemed to care and left it as it was the shower was poor you had to put a towel on the floor as it was all on one level so the water world go every where without the towl . The lift you had to use your room key in to go up to your room this seemed to be a hit and miss thing did not matter how slow or fast you pasted the key sometimes it did no work and you spend 5 to 10 minutes trying to get it to work.The staff where ok but I think do need a bit of training.If you looking for top rate hotel with everything perfect look else where.But if you looking for A quite cheap hotel .Where you can sleep and spend more time doing othe things seeing the sites ect.Then this hotel passes the test Here A few tips that I hope will help if you decided to stay here Getting to Darling Harbour from hotel Walk along Wentworth Avenue to Elizabeth street then along Elizabeth street to Liverpool street .If you walk along liverpool street into the centre of Town then if you carry on along Liverpool street you will be in Darling Harbour.I know there are other ways to get to Darling Harbour this is just one from the hotel TIPWoolwoths is on Park street to get here Walk along Wentworth Avenue to Elizabeth street then along Elizabeth street Park st is the 3rd or 4fh street off Elizabeth street Hope these help some of you
