Fantastic hotel

Like all the other reviews we read, we loved this hotel. Service was superb and the reception staff were friendly, helpful and great at recommending restaurants to visit in the evenings, they even booked them for us and orgnised taxis. The reataurant in the hotel was excellent too and very reasonably priced. The rooms were very cool - a bit like the Morrison Hotel in Dublin, minimalist and chic. Can't wait to go back
