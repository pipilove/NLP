Do not stay here

Well I was greatly disappointed after reading rave reviews on this site. Firstly the staff are appalling, unfriendly and any request from you as a guest is treated with disdain. It took me one hour to get some food up to the terrace for my elderly mother, breakfast was a joke - so badly organised that we ended up laying our own table one morning. It is also incredibly noisy. This place has been put up quickly with untrained staff to make money. I read, just before leaving, that someone had their luggage stolen in reception area and this doesn't surprise me as they couldn't care less. I chose this hotel because I was travelling with my mother and seven year old and thought that after a day's sightseeing it would be a nice place to sit by. It is dusty, the umbrellas don't work and the view could be Calcutta. I looked longing over at the Hotel Angleterre's beautiful terrace across the street. The pool, be the way, is 4 metres by 3m and 1 metre deep so whoever stayed there and enjoyed doing laps must be vertically challenge! Sorry but it left me feeling ripped off and angry. You need to stay in the Gotica area away from La Ramblas.
