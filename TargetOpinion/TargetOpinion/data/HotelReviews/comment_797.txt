Great hotel!

This is a great place to stay - very classy and stylish. The entrance/lobby area is unusual and the chic, modern theme is continued in the bedrooms. The welcome at Reception was particularly pleasant, personal and informative and good service generally seems to be a feature of the hotel. The meal in the elegant restaurant was very good, though rather expensive, and here too service was excellent. Free Internet access is available in the lobby. The hotel is well situated for the shops and the Zoo railway station.Breakfast at the hotel was very expensive so I ate at a nice restaurant/bar at a third of the hotel price (left outside the hotel and first left, then it's on the left after ca. 300 metres).The hotel is expensive though off-peak deals can be found. I paid 拢97.50/night but I have recently seen 拢39.33 (room only) for December and January.
