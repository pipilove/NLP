great little hotel

this little hotel is great. first of all it has a great location just off the Dam square. right under this hotel,(as many are actually upstairs there) is shopping and a few good places to eat! When you first arrive there is a buzzer door you smile into the camera and they buzz the door open for you. in you go and the craziest stairs are right in front of you to the hotel level on the second floor. when you are arriving they send someone down to greet you and carry your baggage up for you as there is no elevator. up the stairs is the front desk with a humorous and very helpful staff. Of all the hotels i have stayed at in amsterdam, this one has had the best service.of course the rooms are tiny, but who needs them while in this cool city. they were clean and comfy and i had a canal view room with a spacious balcony for two or three even with chairs. More about the location, it is only five minutes walk to the dam square which is great since we were there for new years. it lies i believe west of the dam for your info and in a good area too!they practice the notion of keeping your room key for you when you go out so no worry of losing it since you probably wont remember much any way!
