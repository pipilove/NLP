Uneven service, loud housekeeping, but a nice property.

We had a three-night stay here from June 19 for our wedding honeymoon. Our superior room had a nice large patio, but the room itself was small (more like the classic rooms from the picture).Noise was an issue -- not because of Las Ramblas, but because the chattering housekeepers would laugh up a storm in the hallways early every morning (before 9 AM).More generally, service was uneven: sometimes friendly, sometimes surly. (1) Doorman did not help us with our bags upon depature, even after seeing us carrying them. (2) Doorman told us a cab would take 10 minutes, even though walking one building over enabled us to get one ourselves in 1 minute. (3) Housekeepers were extremely noisy in the hallways as mentioned above. (4) Spa/gym attendant required us to put plastic booties over clean sneaker in order to view the gym, so as not to scuff the floors (which makes no sense in a gym). For 350 Euro/night, guests deserve better service.
