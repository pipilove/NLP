great location, mediocre quality

We stayed here for about a week over new years. the great thing about this hotel is that when you finally arrive at centraal station after a long and tiring plane ride, you don't have to walk very far at all before you're greeted by the site of this historic looking hotel.the locatation is superb, as it is within a few minutes of dam square and has easy metro access to get to such venues as the van gogh museum.on the other hand, this hotel is NO WHERE NEAR 4 STAR QUALITY. Do not let the online travel sites fool you. This is a solid 3 star hotel (no, not even 3.5 stars). There's nothing particularly bad about it, but it's not anything you'll be writing home about either.The rooms are somewhat small and the bathrooms are cramped. maid service was absent throughout our stay, but that didn't bother us. They did leave fresh towels outside the door every morning.All in all, a decent place to stay, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're trying to impress anyone (ie your significant other). you'll both be somewhat disappointed by the size and quality of the rooms.
