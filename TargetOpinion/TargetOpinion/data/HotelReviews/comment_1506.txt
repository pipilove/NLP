Good location, staff could have been more helpful

The location of the hotel is good - fairly close to everything. The rooms were clean and we had a balcony and a great view of the Space Needle (I'd recommend asking for a space needle view, if you book). The price was alright as well, at least in comparison to other hotels in Seattle.... Problems: There isn't a moderate / good for family restaurant in the hotel and it is hard to find these in the hotel neighborhood as well, unless you just want fast food. (There is a small grocery/wine store across the street that is open until late, which was really nice!) The staff was not friendly, nor helpful. The front desk was unable to give us walking directions to the wharf (I would have thought a lot of people would have asked for that...). There was also problems with getting a late checkout - because our flight out was at 6pm, I had emailed the hotel before we left for Seattle to get a late check-out. The hotel had responded that, that wouldn't be a problem. When we checked in, the front desk clerk said we had to ask the night before we check out. When I asked that night, he said we had to call down in the morning....just extra unneccessary hassle. Overall, I'd stay somewhere else on my next trip.
