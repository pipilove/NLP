NOT the typical SPG hotel, much worse!

I recently spend a week at the St Francis on business; It was a fright from the moment I got to my floor. The doorman, front desk staff, and bell staff were attentive, but didn't warn me about my room... It was on a newly renovated floor that smelled of mothballs (I was told it was the new carpet), the whole 11th floor smelled so my window (which opened) was of little help. The bell staff that escorted me to my room noticed immediately that the room was not made up properly and left to collect the towels, robe, and missing pillow. The amenities were less then I would expect, I've received better at a Hampton Inn. They were happy to press my suits, but were unable to shine my shoes. Housekeeping skipped my room twice during my stay, and the hotel never offered an apology; only a they'll be right up. All in all, it was a beautiful hotel, but the room was far too small (albeit a old hotel) for the price and the door banged into the bed when I opened it.For the money, stay at the ritz or four seasons...
