Feels Like You Live in Amsterdam

Perfect retreat in a quiet but central area of the city, Seven Bridges makes you feel like you're at home. Breakfast is served in your room where there is table space in front of a beautiful picture window. Room 8 overlooked gardens, but all the rooms had beautiful views. Beds were very comfortable. Evenings were quiet for sleeping. Canal location is gorgeous. The best thing were the hosts as they were as accomodating as possibe - gave guidance on restaurants, provided laptop for use for free internet, provided a great fan when needed(perfect for noise masker and cooling as we like the room cold). You get your own key to the front door so you can come and go as you please. Drawbacks are the very steep stairs (almost ladder like) and the lack of air conditioning (though most places in Amsterdam do not have AC). But overall, the room quality, cleanliness, breakfast and hospitality make this a true bargain.
