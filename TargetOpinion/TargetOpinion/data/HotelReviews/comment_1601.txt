Views on upper floors a hit, parking a miss

Enjoyed a great local package deal with the hotel (check out their local website first for rates). Our room was located on the upper (old) tower floors and in need of updating. The room and beds (not comfortable) showed wear and looked the same as when I last stayed (90's) but the view and staff were outstanding.The hotel has a new updated tower (no high floors) and lost it's parking space-thus now only offers expensive valet parking at 35.00 +tax. The parking attendants were working hard but still have to wait outside in the cold for your car.If we choose to return, we would stay in the new tower and park the car across the street. Overall, an average stay with below average beds.
