Great stay

We recently had a wonderful overnight at the Warwick. It was an easy walk to Seattle Art Museum and even closer to downtown shopping. The front desk was extremely gracious at check in, offering shopping discount coupons and restaurant reservations. We enjoyed breakfast at the hotel and the morning free coffee in the lobby. The waitstaff in both the bar and hotel were attentive. Our room on the 15th floor had a city/water view. While there are hotels closer in downtown, we would have no problem choosing the Warwick again.
