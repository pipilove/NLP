This hotel provided excellent service!! The hotel is an good location close to all the necesaff are say places you would like to visit within a walking distance. The staff are great!! The hotel is slightly expensive but its in a 4 star hotel and its also in the centre of everything and to be honest its not anymore expensive than most places Barcelona. Best hotel ever been too!!
