Modern comfort and style

I enjoyed my stay at the Watertown Hotel. If I could have only one word to describe I would use clean. The hotel staff is fantastic, very friendly and hospitable.They have a thing called ala cart, I never heard of such a thing but I took advantage of it and highly recommend you do the same. There is a list of ala carts available, it is a complementary service, you pick off the list, call the desk and they deliver to your room. ex. I got the spa cart one night, it had shampoo, conditioner, lotion, bath salts, foot bath/massager.Breakfast is nice, lots of fruit, scrambled eggs, bacon or sausage, cerials, muffins, juice, Starbucks coffee (of course)... not to shaby.They have a happy hour in the early evening, good selection of beer/wine, cheese, olives...Parking is free and very secure. The building is very secure, you have to use your room key to operate the elevator.I took advantage of the shuttle service, I was dropped off and picked up right in front of Cutters Seafood by Pikes Market. There are several restaurants within walking distance (3 blocks to a mile). I walked to Kai's Bistro/Loung about 3 blocks away, good happy hours, cheap eats and drinks.There are lots of bicycles available for use.This hotel is tops on my list and I don't plan on staying anywhere else when I am in Seattle.
