Spotless!

We stayed at this hotel because it was near to K'damn and this was our first trip to berlin. We had a standard room on the lower floors overlooking the central courtyard. Probably not the best view if you were staying in mid-winter but perfect in the heat of the summer.The room was spotlessly clean. The bathroom was spacious and immaculate also with the novelty of having a speaker system built in allowing you to listen to the TV while in the bath. A turn down service also added a little more luxury.The spa was great, just what we needed after the hot weather we'd had. Be warned if you are a bit of a prude as most guests are followers of the naked spa regime!Breakfast was fantastic. Everything you could imagine from cereals to freshly made pancakes with maple syrup(recommended).The lobby and cocktail bar were a lovely touch and very relaxing. K'damn is just across the road, as is the Berlin zoo on the opposite side. Both a great day out. Also the tour bus goes from just outside one of the many HMs located on the K'damn.Tiergarten is great for a leisurely wander in the evening. If you're lucky you might just come across a great beer garden near the spanish? embassy which sells pizza and 2 huge litre glasses of beer for 15 euro. Follow the collection of bikes down to this beautiful area by the lake. Once again beware the naked berliners (conservative Irish person speaking) in the park and also the mosquitos!
