Great place - TERRIBLE accoustics

I've stayed at this place two different weeks. I love it - I love the concept. However, BRING EARPLUGS! This is the second time that near midnight the footsteps of the guests above sound like kick drums. I'm not a light sleeper. There's nothing to be done about this - but it is ridiculous.
