Very good, but not four star great.

Stayed here for five days starting August 19th. Loved the friendly staff, great breakfast and location. The free mini bar is ok but doesn't really offset the musty room that stank of cigarette smoke, the dirty chairs in the lobby, and the not quite sparkling clean bathroom.Although the Banks claims four star status, this is a three star hotel at best.
