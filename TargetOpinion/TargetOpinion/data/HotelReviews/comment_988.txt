Shabby

My husband and I just returned from Paris with our daughter and her husband. We booked this hotel (two rooms, 4 nights) based upon the positive reviews on this website. When we arrived we were so disapointed by the appearance of this hotel. It was shabby and bordered dirty. There was a bad smell in the rooms and we simply could not stay there. We lost over $300 since we had booked in advance, but it was worth it to go to a nicer hotel. Perhaps this hotel has other nicer rooms since apparently there were many people happy with their stay here, but our rooms were not acceptable.
