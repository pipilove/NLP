Loved the Location

We stay at many Marriotts. The Renaissance Parc 55 was what I would classify as fine. The lobby was pretty, however the hallways and the rooms were just average size and were a little worn. The service was very good, however we had a major problem with the doorman and a limo company, which has yet to be resolved.The location was wonderful. You could walk virtually everywhere, or take the Powell Street Cable car 1.5 blocks away, the BART across the way, or an inexpensive taxi to most sights!I would stay here again.
