Overpriced

Whilst we don't doubt that the hotel was clean, it was sorely overpriced and very unfriendly. There seems to be no soundproofing in between rooms and we had to ask to be moved after our first night, only to find we had the same problem where we were moved to. Whilst some of the staff were friendly to a point, we were disappointed with the service when comparing it to other hotels of the same standard. In short, there are better places you could stay in San Fran.
