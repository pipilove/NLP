Barcelonas Best

Although it has been eight months since my wife and I have stayed at this hotel I would just like to add my opinion of this fine establishment.It has one of the friendliest and most considerate staffs we have come across in all our trips throughout europe. As has been said, some of the rooms may need improvement but if you don't like the first room you are given it is up to you to request another one. We also would like to compliment the wait staff at the bar for their friendliness and courtesy. All these people made our stay in Barcelona much more pleasant.
