Dissapointed! Not what you expect for a 4 star!

Booked this as a suprise weekend away for my partner - wanted it to be special, but it was far from it. The room we were allocated initially was pokey with marks on the carpet and a small bathroom with a shower cubicle. I had no choice about walking out to find an alternative hotel becuase we had paid up front. There wasn't even enough room for a tv stand, it had to be fixed on a bracket attached to the wall. I asked for a room with a bath and the only option was to upgrade - which costs a further æ‹¢100 (120 euros). The breakfast was not included in this. If you want to buy breakfast upfront it costs 11 euros, but if you'd rather not make the decision until later or in the morning, you have to pay 16 euros each. we did eventually upgrade into a room which had limited day light and an artificial window on one side infront of a painted landscape. The day light effect was provided by a naked strip light! The carpet in this room too was dirty. There was a dead insect in the hallway which was there for the 3 days we were. The good thing was that the bathroom was in fact clean, but complimentary toiletries means there is a soap/shampoo/body wash all-in-one dispenser. There were no tea and coffee making facilities either. The 'business centre' had one computer which was engaged whenever we tried to use it. Yes, there are definately 4 stars at the entrance, but this means a very different thing in Germany perhaps? and it looks like they may have once been fit for it, but it is clearly time for a revamp.
