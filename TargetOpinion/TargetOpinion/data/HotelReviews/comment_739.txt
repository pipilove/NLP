I love this hotel!

I spent four days, three nights at the Grand Hyatt Berlin for a holiday weekend. It is wonderful!The staff--from the doorman, to front desk clerk, to the concierge, to the housekeepers--are courteous and friendly. The lobby Christmas decorations were tasteful and gorgeous. And the rooms were well appointed. I particularly liked the zoomy bathroom. I am a very light sleeper. The interior/courtyard room was perfect. I never heard street noise or another guest.The Potsdamer Platz location is outstanding. I heartily recommend this property and would love to stay there again.
