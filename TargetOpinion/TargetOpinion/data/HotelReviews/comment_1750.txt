Watertown compared

So many nice hotels to chose from in Seattle, settled for 2 nites in Pan Pacific and 1 in Watertown. This due to location as we needed to go to the zoo for daughter . Watertown is about 5 minutes away driving from zoo. Downtown is actually close too.While PP was a business like modern classic, Watertown was a Hip modern. Even the room key jacket is a clever folded map of Seattle. The hotel itself is new and very nice. Things i did not like, although not a big minus:- Nice floor to ceiling glass window walls did not have a liner curtain but only the thick light blocking one. Although one assumes that it is dark if looked from outside, not confy to walk in undies with curtains up unless u r a stripper or in good shape( I am neither). Specially since we are facing a construction site and lots of workers. Also our room did not have much outside lighting so had to have lights on most of the time.- Construction noise/view was bad during day. But this seems to be common sight in Seattle as we had the same with PanPacific room.- My wife felt the bed was a bit on the soft side for her likings. I guess this was compared to PP.- Coming from the PP awesome bathroom, Watertown's was small and no separate glass shower stall.The outstanding plus:- Parking underground hotel is free/great, elevator connects to lobby and room. - Well stocked free breakfast, although nothing out of the ordinary. Compares to a hampton inn ones.Other observations:- Wifi would not connect even though it sees the net( No, I am not network illiterate). Used the provided wired lan. No prob.- Did not use any of the amenities, which looked very very good.Overall, can't go wrong with this hotel. Will be happy to stay again here. But as a middle age level family, on the pampering level, we preffered Pan Pacific of the two.If going to Seattle in April, make sure you go to the tulip festival. Acres and acres of colorful tulips. Will make your lady smile.
