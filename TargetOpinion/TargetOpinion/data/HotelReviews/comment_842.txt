Great Hotel - Great Location

This is a great hotel in a great location. The staff are friendly and helpful. The rooms are very clean and a decent size. The breakfast offers a huge variety and no matter what time you decide to eat, there is always a good selection.The only negative thing I can say is that the water is a bit on the hard side so take plenty of toiletries with you.I have stayed in Berlin before but this hotel was by far the best. I would definately stay there again.
