All round good hotel...

We stayed here for 5 nights in April 2006 and found it to be a convenient location, good value, clean, comfortable hotel. I would probably class the location as China town, not Darling Harbour but it's only about a 5 min walk to all the bars and restaurants of Darling Harbour and the monorail station is practically right outside to get you around the city. For the money, I would deffinately reccomend this hotel, the service was good, our safe didn't work when we arrived but they sent someone immediately to fix it. Sydney is now one of my favourite citys in the world and I would stay here again without a doubt.
