Service Sucked!

I go to Seattle at least 4 or 5 times a year for pleasure. I generally stay at the Sheraton because I liked the rooms and service it is right downtown convenient for walking. I was very disappointed in the service since they remodeled their lobby. The best service was from the Valets. That was it. The front desk employees were rude, whether it was on the phone or in person, didn't matter. They just had this attitude that was not appreciated! It started on the phone when I tried to get a room through Sheraton. The rate fluctuated with each phone call and I made 3 of them. I ended up calling and talking to the manager about the reservations department. First I was told that there was a military rate, then I was told that there wasn't one, then that there was only a military rate for the actual active military man and not the spouse. Which doesn't make sense. I gave up. didn't book a room, set my mind that I wouldn't try to stay there again. There are plenty of nice hotels in Seattle. We decided to priceline, got the rate we were looking for without the military discount and ended up at the Sheraton anyways!!! Fate!! Still the service sucked! Rude staff and to top it off you have to pay for the Wi Fi!!! I won't make any effort to stay at the Sheraton again!!
