Beware overbooking

We had a reservation - secured with a credit card for 2 nights 14-16 April. We had notified the hotel of our expected arrival time - 11pm.We arrived by taxi from the airport exhausted and looking forward to going to our room, taking a hot shower and getting some sleep.At reception as soon as I mentioned the booking it became obvious there was a problem. There was no room for us but they had booked another hotel down the street. No apology, no compensation for the inconvenience etc. It was late, I have limited mobility and made to feel I was making a fuss!!!At that time of night we had no other choice but to go to this other hotel.Compensation - 1 bottle of cheap wine  breakfast.If we had booked the alternative hotel ourselves it would have cost us less, instead we paid Jolly Hotel Vivaldi prices.We feel we have been ripped off!!!!!
