Great But No Cigar

I stayed at this hotel back in 2002 for my 2nd visit to Amsterdam. On arrving i was really impressed. The reception was really nice and the staff were really helpful and friendly.The room was clean and of decent size and in my view good value for money.However the bath was way too small. If your 6 feet tall forgot it. Also the connecting door to the room next dor was paper thin. You could here the occupents next door talking for god sake. Also didn`t help when they got up to leave at 4am the next day :-(My last grumble was that housekeeping staff started at 7.30am!!!.On the whole i would give this hotel 3 out of 5. A vast improvement on the Hotel Atlanta which i stayed at in 2001 but not as good as the Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw where i stayed in 2003.I will be staying at the NH Schiller this May so will write a report to see how they compare.RegardsRyan K
