Great location

Myself and a friend stayed at the Duquesne Eiffel Hotel for 3 nights in November. We had a wonderful trip. We arrived at 10pm in the middle of a massive downpour. The receptionist was joking with us and it lightened our moods. He made a reservation for us at a lovely little Italian restaurant a 5 minute walk away, and we were very happy with this, as we would never have found it on our own. The hotel was kept very clean at all times and the decor is lovely, but I believe they are currently redecorating. We stayed in a twin room called Madeleine; the rooms all seem to be named after areas of Paris. It was a small but perfectly adequate room, the beds were very narrow but I enjoyed a perfect sleep every night. The bathroom was perfect, there was a separate toilet, which was good when there are 2 staying in the room, however a wash hand basin in the toilet room would have been useful. We had a view of the Eiffel Tower from the room, which was fabulous, especially when it sparkles for 10 minutes every hour on the hour. We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel, but enjoyed it along our way out every morning and there were many lovely places to choose from. The drinks in the mini bar were cheap compared to most hotels I have stayed in and compared to the prices in cafes and restaurants around the city. The metro station at Ecole Militaire is very close by, but we found the hotel was very well located for exploring on foot. The Eiffel Tower is very near by and from there, many other sights are within easy walking distance. We even walked back from the Latin quarter late one night and we felt very safe. I would recommend this hotel and I would definitely stay there again.
